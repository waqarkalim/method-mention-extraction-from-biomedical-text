The conjugated R.I.CK ( fluorescein ) -Tat9 was retained in the filter as retentates and separated from the cleaved free R.I.CK ( fluorescein ) -Tat9 that passed through the filter .
Thereafter , the fluorescence of conjugated R.I.CK ( fluorescein ) -Tat9 was measured using a Tecan fluorescence microplate reader with an excitation wavelength at 485 nm and an emission wavelength at 535 nm .
This method was used rather than measuring fluorescence in the flow-through , since the concentration of cleaved R.I.CK ( fluorescein ) -Tat9 could not be quantified due a high degree of adsorption caused by its positive charges ( unpublished data ) .

Positive isolation from primary culture with the anti-Thy-1 mAb AS02 and Dynabeads® M-450 goat anti-mouse IgG was also tested .
This method was unsuitable because : first , the percentages of contaminating macrophages were too high / variable ( 2-15 % ) ; second , the isolated SFB showed a significantly reduced surface density for Thy-1 ( MFI 19 versus 152 before isolation ; n = 4 , P ≤ 0.05 ) , presumably due to contact with the mAb used for isolation ; third , the magnetobeads remained attached to the positively isolated SFB for as long as 1 week , thus requiring further manipulation for their removal ( eg with anti-idiotypic mAbs ) ; fourth , a substantial proportion of SFB ( approximately 30 % ) was lost into the negative fraction ; and , finally , a Thy-1-dependent isolation technique bore the risk of selecting for SFB subpopulations , since the prolyl-4-hydroxylase+ cells obtained by negative isolation with Dynabeads® M-450 CD14 contained both a Thy-1+ fraction ( RA , 49.3± 14.9 % , n = 6 ; OA , 43.6 ± 12.0 % , n = 4 ) and a Thy-1- fraction , as demonstrated by double-staining FACS analysis .

This method of ortholog assignment has the advantage of stringently avoiding contamination of paralogs , because these genes are annotated based not only on sequence homology but also on evidence from functional and physiological examinations .

This approach requires to fit as many such regressions as there are response time points , and therefore it requires a large number of parameters with the associated problems .

The idea that domain-domain interactions should be discovered as putative explanations of protein-protein interactions rather than predictors of these interactions was also the cornerstone of a recently proposed Parsimonious Explanation ( PE ) method [ 2 ] , which assumes that interactions between proteins evolved in a parsimonious way , and uses optimization to predict domain interactions .
Lee and colleagues [ 3 ] improved on a previous work [ 21 ] by creating what we refer to in this paper as the Integrated Bayesian ( IB ) method .
This method estimates the likelihood of domain interactions based on a protein interaction network from four different organisms ( prediction from each network is treated as independent evidence ) , and on the amount of biological evidence relating two domains , such as co-occurrence of domains in the same protein and existence of common GO terms at the functional level .

This occurs when there is best least squares fit between both the T wave and its inverted image along the isoelectric line within the TP segment .
This method is equivalent to using the T wave as a template which measures itself .


./BMC_Cardiovasc_Disord/BMC_Cardiovasc_Disord-5-_-1262700.nxml.sentences
The Novel algorithm displayed a superior accuracy compared to the other measurement algorithms because the method uses the template of the T wave to in effect measure its own offset .
It uses an inverted image of itself as a template to determine the first time at which the upright T wave and its inverted image return together to a common isoelectric baseline .
This method therefore is the common measure of the physiological end for both the inverted and upright T waves , rather than using a surrogate marker for the end of the T wave as seen in the other algorithm methods .

This circumvents the problems posed by earlier methods by directly estimating the pairwise rate of nucleotide substitution over the set of pairs of sequences straddling the subtype divergence without any further rate assumptions other than the existence of a mean .
However , this method is only capable of determining the rate between two subtypes where a third , more distantly related , subtype functions as an outgroup .
This method thus trades the ad hoc rate assumptions of the previous methods with two implicit conditions : ( i ) that subtypes have a unique divergence and ( ii ) a third , comparable subtype is available to serve as an outgroup .

When a functional region has been identified in one gene family member , but the majority of the amino acids making up the functional region are aligned with gaps and/or are experiencing neutral changes , the region is likely not functioning in the same manner in the other sequences analyzed .
Examples include conserved domains IV and V in the FoxA cluster and the transactivation domain in the FoxI cluster ( Figure 2A , C , see Additional file 3 ( A , C ) ) .
This method identifies a region of amino acids that are less likely to be important for a specific function , which may then be examined last for functional significance when using in vitro methods .

We accounted for anti-hypertensive medication use in these analyses using two different approaches .
First , we removed those on medication from the analysis ( annotated bp-med ) .
This method of accounting for medication was used in the previous study of blood pressure in this population [ 13 ] and was chosen because anecdotal evidence suggest that compliance to prescription guidelines are not rigid in the OOA community and members tend not to control their blood pressure tightly with medication .

Biologically , we know that SNPs in close proximity are not independent , and therefore we are " overcorrecting " when we use the traditional Bonferroni method to adjust significance thresholds for multiple testing in GWAS studies [ 11 ] .
We propose Bonferroni corrected p-value thresholds that account for the interdepdendence of SNPs on commonly used commercially available SNP " chips " ( Illumina 317 K and Affymetrix 500 K ) and in the HapMap panels .
This method is an extension of the Bonferroni correction that accounts for the underlying linkage disequilibrium or dependence in dense SNP panels .

Similar to SAM , PIR penalizes lowly expressed genes and provides a permutation-based estimate of the false discovery rate .
In contrast to SAM , PIR allows for the dose-response relationship to be nonlinear , but assumes the relationship is increasing or decreasing as a function of increasing dose , and not the reverse direction .
This method results in a score ( the Mi-statistic ) for each probe set that quantifies the evidence for an increasing or decreasing dose-response relationship .

We have successfully developed a rapid , robust and cost-effective method for the screening of five of the known aminoglycoside-induced deafness mutations .
The SNaPshot technique is particularly well-suited for the screening of mitochondrial DNA variants for the following reasons : i ) the short intron-less mitochondrial genes means that the entire gene can be PCR-amplified and screened in a single PCR fragment and ii ) homoplasmic mutations ( such as the ones investigated in the present study ) are represented as a single peak at each locus which simplifies the analysis .
This method is also less labour-intensive and less prone to false positives compared to the other methods reported to date .

It preserves the underlying two-dimensional nature of the data and produces direct pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity , incorporating any correlation that might exist between these two measures .
The model can be extended to include explanatory variables leading to separate effects on sensitivity and specificity .
This method has two advantages over the standard methods : ( 1 ) the pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity take into account the correlation between these two measures ; ( 2 ) the effect of possible sources of heterogeneity on both sensitivity and specificity can be investigated in a single model rather than just looking at the effect of these variables on a single measure of test performance , the DOR .

Analysis of genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying circadian clocks in whole animals or isolated tissues is facilitated by the use of molecular reporters , such as firefly luciferase ( luc ) .
The use of firefly-luciferase ( luc ) as a real-time molecular reporter of gene expression has been illustrated in a variety of model systems including cyanobacteria , plants , Drosophila , and mammals [ 15-18 ] .
This method has proved especially valuable in studies about molecular rhythms because real-time expression of clock genes and other chronobiological factors may be monitored over many daily cycles in vivo   [ 17 , 6 , 19-21 ] .

Consequently , since choice was best described as a linear function of probability , indifference probabilities were calculated for sham-operated and AcbC-lesioned rats , namely the probability at which rats were equally likely to choose the small / certain and large / uncertain reinforcers .

Ten day training to write verbal autopsy reports followed by constant monitoring of the submitted reports resulted in arriving at the probable underlying cause of death for most of the deaths and to compute broad classification of the underlying causes of about 90 % of deaths in early adult life or middle age : in old age , however , the proportion classifiable is substantially lower .
The specific causes of death arrived based on verbal autopsy reports were used to estimate death rates for Chennai city [ 16 ] and to estimate the risk of death associated with smoking for broad groups of causes of death [ 18 ] .
This methodology of arriving cause of death for adult deaths by verbal autopsy is now being adopted by the Registrar General of India , Govt. of India , for nationwide use in the Sample Registration System ( SRS ) that consists of 6671 units ( 4436 rural and 2235 urban ) spread across the country covering 1.1 million households and about 6 million population .

In a previous paper ( 4 ) , we reported that stripping voltammetry ( SV ) of MMC at the accumulation potentials corresponding to MMC reduction ( between -0.3 and -0.4 V vs SCE ) produces a useful analytical signal in aqueous solutions .
Also , at these accumulation potentials , MMC is so strongly adsorbed at the mercury electrode that the MMC layer can be washed and transferred to the electrolyte ( not containing any dissolved MMC ) , where it produces a response similar to that obtained with the electrode immersed in the MMC solution .
This method , termed transfer stripping voltammetry ( TSV ) , is useful for MMC determination in biological fluids containing interfering substances that are either not adsorbed at the electrode or that are separated in the washing step .


./Biol_Proced_Online/Biol_Proced_Online-1-_-140114.nxml.sentences
Determining MMC by TSV made it possible : ( a ) to adsorb MMC at the HMDE from media not suitable for conventional voltammetric analysis and to perform the electrochemical measurements in the medium of choice ( i.e. AFP ) ; ( b ) to exploit the differences in the adsorbability of MMC and other substances to separate them at the electrode in the washing step ; ( c ) to study the influence of the electrode potential on MMC signals ; ( d ) to study the interaction of immobilized MMC with other substances as DNA , since it is known that MMC interacts with guanine residues in DNA .
For substances accumulated at the electrode surface by adsorption that do not require any accumulation potential ( i.e. DNA ) , the modified electrode can be prepared by immersing the electrode in a drop of the substance at open circuit .

Over the past three decades , field surveys using a cluster sample design have become a standard , popular , and widely used method of measuring key nutrition and health indicators in humanitarian emergencies [ 1-4 ] .
This method was first widely popularized by the Expanded Program on Immunization ( EPI ) of the World Health Organization , which since 1978 has promoted using a 30 cluster design , with 7 children per cluster ( popularly known as " 30 × 7 " ) for measuring immunization coverage [ 5 , 6 ] .

The key to REMI transgenesis involves mixing transgene DNA with purified and permeabilized sperm , along with a small quantity of restriction enzyme and an extract of egg cytoplasm generated by high-speed centrifugation ( the key ingredient of which is thought to be nucleoplasmin , which serves to partially decondense the sperm chromatin , facilitating transgene insertion ) ; this mixture is then injected into dejellied eggs at the rate equivalent to about one sperm per egg .
Around a third of the recipient eggs usually cleave normally and a proportion ( around 50 % ) of these integrate the transgene into the genome during the first cell cycle .

The most commonly used methods compare the species tree that describes the relationships among taxa to the gene tree inferred from the sequences of the gene family being studied [ 9-14 ] .
By reconciling the gene tree with the species tree , both gene gains and losses can be inferred and mapped onto the species tree .
This method has been applied to many individual gene trees ( for example , [ 15 ] ) , and is only now finding wider usage in whole genome analyses ( for example , [ 16 ] ) .

A further possibility to account for reconciliation bias on non-informative branches is to iteratively remove descendant branches from the gene trees to be reconciled .
Because incorrect duplications are placed on these branches only when there are genes from three or more descendant branches , pruning the trees so that only two or fewer lineages are represented may allow for more accurate reconstruction of the number of duplicates on these branches .
This method then essentially turns ' non-informative ' branches into ' informative ' branches by reducing the possibility that gene trees are incorrect .

Recently , a new method has been elaborated to measure SOS gene expression and promoter activity of the SOS-genes ( e.g. , recA , lexA , umuDC ) by using a plasmid bearing an SOS promoter to be investigated fused to the reporter gene gfp-encoding green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) 26 , 27. This allows one to measure the promoter activity of SOS genes in a single bacterial cell , as well as localization and duration of the SOS induction .
It appears that induction of the SOS genes does not proceed as a single event , but follows in several repeatable steps whose modulation depends on the SOS-inducing dose , the level of damage in the DNA , and the UmuD ' protein accumulation .
This method opens a new way to measuring the dynamics of the SOS response .

Previous methods to construct a network-based local neighbourhood have used journey endpoints ( e.g. 1 km along the road network ) as vertices from which to build a polygon delineating the neighbourhood .
This method presents a vast improvement over the simple circular buffer method because it takes into account that the area of a " local neighbourhood " is necessarily restricted by the manner in which one is able to traverse the landscape - a pedestrian can not travel " as the crow flies " but is instead forced to travel along existing roadways .

The mathematical part of the method we have presented has a direct correspondence with a graphical network description , where nodes represent whether or not an element or a property of the component is present , and where the strength of the links between nodes carries information about the effects of these elements on the stability of the complex .
Therefore , our approach accounts for the precise stochastic biochemical dynamics , as shown by the prototype systems considered here , while keeping the simplicity of qualitative methods based on network diagrams .
This methodology thus offers a solid starting point to move from qualitative to quantitative understanding of protein-protein ( Jansen et al , 2003 ) , protein-DNA ( Edwards et al , 2002 ) , and other interaction networks ( Tavazoie et al , 1999 ; Shen-Orr et al , 2002 ) on a genomic scale .

Correlation of less than 1.0 is expected , as sensitivity is a local property dependent on actual position in parameter space , which varies from fit to fit , but the mean value of R=0.84 implies significant similarity in sensitive parameters across fits .
We explored this issue further using a more robust but less familiar measure of ‘regional ' sensitivity : where 〈…〉AVG indicates an average over parameter values lying within 102.5-fold above and below the parameter values of the fit .
This method of calculating average local sensitivity has been discussed previously ( Cukier et al , 1973 ; Bentele , 2004 ; Mahdavi , 2007 ) and has two advantages over simple sensitivity : ( i ) it accounts for the possibility that a fit does not precisely hit a nearby minimum due to problems with convergence during SA and ( ii ) it reduces the impact on sensitivity of small but steep irregularities in the landscape of the objective function .

To explore this possibility , we reasoned that many genes that are coregulated in S. cerevisiae should also be coregulated in other fungal species , and that functional cis-regulatory elements could be identified with the same methods applied to coregulated S. cerevisiae genes .
Therefore , for each group of coregulated S. cerevisiae genes , we identified orthologs in each of 13 other fungal genomes using the method of Wall et al. ( 2003 ) .
This method identifies reciprocal BLAST hits between two genomes that span more than 80 % of the protein lengths , thereby providing a more conservative list of putative orthologs than a simple BLAST method .

In this work , we have designed and implemented a protocol that augments the results from Rosetta ab initio modeling by using cryoEM density as a means for assessment .
This methodology ( described in detail in Materials and Methods ) leverages the medium-resolution density envelope supplied by the cryoEM density map to provide the overall shape and density distribution in evaluating models when no structural homolog is known .

Improved prediction by addition of a new feature establishes the importance of that feature .
Conversely , lack of improvement indicates that the new feature is redundant with previously known features .

For 13 subjects , this peak was the only peak , indicating pure exponential discounting .
For seven subjects the first peak was followed by a prominent second peak ; two of these subjects had a secondary isolated peak ( near k = 0.75 sec−1 ) , and for five of these subjects , a higher frequency component appeared at k = 1 sec−1 ( e.g. , subject 3 ) .
This method confirmed the results of the generalized hyperbolic model fit , as 13 subjects were identified as pure exponential discounters by both methods .

As the size of these datasets increases , conventional methods to detect these so-called common insertion sites ( CISs ) no longer suffice , and an approach is required that can control the error independent of the dataset size .
The authors introduce a framework that uses a technique called kernel density estimation to find the regions in the genome that show a significant increase in insertion density .
This method is implemented over a range of scales , allowing the data to be evaluated at any relevant scale .

On each repetition the neuron signatures were shuffled amongst all neurons ( shuffling the neuron labels as described above in the prediction assay ) .
To calculate p-values we repeated the shuffling 1,000 times and computed the probability to achieve a score equal or higher than the score of the original ( nonshuffled ) data .
This methodology was chosen since , in contrast to the prediction assay , the scores obtained by the shuffling procedure were not normally distributed .

We studied the alignment files produced by RepeatMasker to identify all the single-nucleotide differences between each interspersed repeat ( with the same exclusions as in ROAST ) and its corresponding consensus sequence .
These differences can be assumed to represent directional mutations from the consensus sequence state to the extant sequence state ( Figure S2A ) .
This method is akin to the “substitution rate” method described by Green et al. but is applied to the content of interspersed repeats .

Unlike Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics sampling schemes , the algorithm itself has no knowledge of the starting conformation of the loop .
The entire conformational space of the loop is sampled with varying sampling resolution in a hierarchical manner .

./PLoS_Comput_Biol/PLoS_Comput_Biol-2-4-1447661.nxml.sentences
In other cases , this strategy performs poorly because the phosphorylation induces substantial conformational changes in the surroundings of the loop , as discussed for CDK2 above .
In order to capture these essential structural rearrangements in the region surrounding the loop , we also optimize the conformations of all side chains that have at least one atom within 4.5 Å of the loop , as described in Materials and Methods .
This method permits all cases , excepting extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 ( ERK2 ) , to be predicted with near-atomic accuracy , especially the phosphate group itself .

At higher SNP densities , where the haplotype structure of the human genome becomes relevant , an approach that considers the dependence among multiple SNPs in a region of LD is necessary in addition to the LD-HMM .
We used a haplotype correction that compared regions of inferred putative LOH to a set of reference normal samples to reduced false LOH inference .

The SPL combines information on global topological organization with the connective structure of the network and relative abundances of local subgraphs , data which are all proven powerful tools for annotating gene expression data [ 29 ] , inferring network mechanisms [ 30 ] , and classifying networks into families [ 31 ] .
The figurative representation of SPLs ( e.g. , Figure 1 ) is also a visualization of the inner structures of a regulatory network which could be used to obtain a clearer picture of network activity .
This method for network subgraph analysis might also be applied to other biological or non-biological networks , such as metabolic networks , neuronal circuits , or electronic chips .

The resulting combination of KG and growth environment shift is then considered the experiment design with the greatest potential for providing the most new regulatory rules .
This presumption is based on the power law nature of TRNs [ 17 , 18 ] , which implies that more highly connected TFs are more likely to be involved in undiscovered regulatory interactions .
This methodology has the added advantage of ( dis ) confirming rules already in the model , but this becomes less of an issue as subsequent iterations utilize more speculative information in place of rules in the model as a basis for suggesting experiment designs .

The formation of hydrogen bonds between aligned , complementary nucleotides is the basis of Watson-Crick hybridization and results in a more stable , double-stranded structure with lower free energy than the participating single-stranded sequences .
One long-standing implementation of this model , Mfold [ 11 ] , quantifies the degree of hybridization and the stability of RNA secondary structure by calculating the change in energy ( ΔG ° ) [ 12-14 ] .
This method for estimating free energy has been adapted to identify SD sequences by repeatedly calculating the ΔG ° values for progressive alignments of the rRNA tail with the mRNA in the region upstream of the start codon [ 5 , 6 , 15 , 16 ] .

A novel method , transposon site hybridization , was implemented and applied to determine essential genes in M. tuberculosis under nutrient-rich conditions [ 8 , 20 ] .
Briefly , this procedure involved two steps : ( 1 ) random disruption of genes by transposon mutagenesis to generate growth mutants , and ( 2 ) competitive hybridization between insertion and gene probes to identify mutants that could not survive in nutrient-rich media .
This method predicted 614 genes essential for growth in vitro , but with a predicted 1 % false discovery rate [ 8 ] .

Given a method for assessing interaction reliability , we also sought to organize high-confidence interactions into TF modules ( i.e. , sets of TFs that cooperatively regulate sets of genes ) .
For this purpose , we applied an algorithm that identified all TF combinations regulating common targets and assigned p-values of significance to these overlaps [ 26 ] .
This method of module identification is scalable to much larger datasets , which will be particularly necessary in view of the complex transcriptional regulation observed in higher eukaryotes [ 8 ] .

This high number is then reduced by only keeping hairpins that are conserved in other species .
Another approach is to search only transcribed sequences in the form of expressed sequence tags [ 7 , 8 ] .

Traditionally , for diallelic alleles with p1 and p2 allele frequencies , the HET rate could be estimated as hr = 2p1p2 , although this formula is appropriate only for alleles in HWE .
Another approach , which is robust to HWE assumptions , is to estimate the HET rate ( and its variance ) directly by population allele frequencies [ 16 ] .

As a first step to investigate this response , model-predicted trends of desensitization ( Figure 6A ) were experimentally verified ( Figure 6B ) , and showed that a minimum time of about 3 h is required after ligand stimulation for the cells to become fully responsive to the readdition of LIF .

The relative age of these TEs over evolutionary time is implicit in their organization , because newer TEs have necessarily transposed into older TEs that were already present .

When associations between nucleus compartments are of interest , it has been argued by Jacobs and colleagues that constraining the analysis to two dimensions actually makes statistical tests more stringent , since random ( expected ) colocalisations will be less frequent if the foci are given more room to roam , and will lower the threshold of the significance [ 10 ] .
Otherwise , meaningful results have been obtained by studying distribution patterns in flattened 2D cell nuclei [ 11 , 12 ] .
This method can not be used to calculate absolute distances because of the disruptive effects of the cell preparation method on cell nucleus topology , but is generally considered sufficient for statistical analysis of relative distance measurements .

It is also possible to quantify relative spatial proximity in terms of orbital arrangement using the angle formed between compartments and the nuclear centre .
This method was originally used to study the positions of chromosomes on prometaphase chromosome rosettes [ 19 , 36 ] and has been used more recently in interphase cells [ 20 ] , where the wide range of angles measured between homologous chromosomes argued against the existence of a highly ordered orbital arrangement of chromosomes .

This is accomplished by finding the threshold where the total area enclosed by the contour is the least sensitive to small changes in the threshold value .

If a locus is unlinked to the phenotype , it will not show preferential inheritance in either pooled sample and therefore will show an averaged baseline of inheritance ( Figure 5C ) .
For a linked locus , the genomic DNA in one pool will be enriched for one parental inheritance , and therefore will show a peak of inheritance when comparing the array results across the pooled progeny of the phenotype ( Figures 5A and B ) .
This method allowed us to screen a large number of segregants and measure the average genotype of progeny within each pool .

This method is designed to avoid over-interpretation of statistically significant findings that are not likely to signify a true positive .

Accurate measurement of the rate of dye bleaching was precluded by systematic effects such as tissue movement , dye diffusion and slow laser noise ; we conservatively estimate it to be less than 30 % after one hour of continuous full-frame scanning at the maximum excitation power available to us .
Such a low rate of photobleaching suggests that a significant improvement in fluorescence yield could be achieved with a more powerful laser .
This method of measuring transmembrane voltage therefore holds the promise of reaching signal-to-noise ratios comparable to those achieved with quiet cameras and widefield illumination [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] while benefiting from all the advantages of two-photon excitation : the ability to see much deeper into tissue than with widefield single-photon excitation ( Figure 3d ) , as well as relative insensitivity to tissue autofluorescence and out-of-focus labeling resulting from the optical sectioning inherent in non-linear absorption .

They do , however , continue to decay in “strength” through the homosynaptic depression .
Since the axon withdrawal is reversible—if one of the supersynapses dips below ΘS—continuing to track the strength is a way for the system to have some memory of its past configuration , though that memory should fade in time if the neuron remains saturated for a long time .
This method was chosen because withdrawals in the network occur instantaneously rather than through a more realistic gradual process .

When only such genomes are included , the correlation between the degree of deviation in nonfunctional DNA and the number of tRNA genes increases ( r = 0.63 and p < 0.001 , solid line in Fig. 5 ) .

To identify compounds with an inhibitory effect , a reliable assay for Dam activity is required , ideally one readily adapted to high throughput screening .
Perhaps the most reliable reported method for measurement of Dam activity involved monitoring the incorporation of a 3H labelled methyl group ( transferred from 3H labelled AdoMet ) to an adenine residue within a DNA substrate , typically either calf thymus DNA [ 14 ] or a short double stranded oligonucleotide [ 15 ] .
This method has allowed the kinetic analysis of a number of DNA adenine methyltransferases , including that from E. coli [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , bacteriophage T2 [ 18 ] and bacteriophage T4 [ 19 ] , but using this type of discontinuous assay for detailed kinetic studies is labour intensive .

However , using usual stepwise regression to find the optimal combination of explanatory variables to model a response is often considered to be a high-variance operation because small perturbations of the response data can sometimes lead to vastly different subsets of the variables [ 51 ] , [ 52 ] .

To reflect the self-reinforcing effects of victory and defeat , DOM-values are updated by increasing the DOM-value of the winner and decreasing that of the loser by the same amount .
Furthermore , the size of the change in the DOM-value depends on the intensity of aggression and on the degree to which the outcome of a fight was expected : if a high ranking one wins from a low-ranking one as expected , this results in a minimal change in both DOM-values , but if unexpectedly , a low ranking one outcompetes a higher ranking individual , DOM-values of both opponents are changed by a larger amount .

The recent finding by Markakis et al. [ 14 ] that GnRH-immunoreactive cells can be derived from in vitro expanded adult progenitor cells prompted us to set up a NS assay using either fetal or adult rat hypothalamic tissue and verify if we could detect cells with GnRH-phenotype in these cultures .
The advantage of the NS assay is that stem / progenitor cells can be 1 ) isolated and propagated in a serum free medium , 2 ) studied at clonal density , and 3 ) stimulated to induce the differentiation of the whole population of the growing cells .
This method should also help to determine whether fetal CNS progenitors have the potential to generate GnRH neurons .

Some susceptibility genes have been located using different mapping strategies .
One of the mapping strategies is “candidate-gene linkage analysis” .
This method is effective for mapping genes with large phenotypic effects that follow Mendelian laws of inheritance using a large-pedigree linkage approach , and its success in identifying novel hypertension genes is best described by Lifton 's works [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] .

Using this approach , approximately 10 genes were linked to the causality of hypertension , which account for only a small fraction of the essential hypertension etiology .
Another mapping strategy is “genome-wide linkage approach” .

Population variability ( PV ) , which is a relatively new method proposed for measuring temporal variation [ 18 ] , quantifies variability as the average percentage difference between all combinations of data points and was calculated using MATLAB .
PV is supposed to be less sensitive to extreme events , such as zero counts and large deviations from the mean , than CV .
This method is therefore especially appropriate when comparing variability of populations experiencing different types of dynamics because PV measures variability on a proportional scale .
