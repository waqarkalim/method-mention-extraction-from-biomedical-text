Recently , Sado et al. introduced a novel way of producing monoclonal antibodies in rats called the “rat lymph node method” [ 5 , 9 , 10 ] .
This method is characterized by injection of antigens into the skin of footpads followed by collection of B cells from medial iliac lymph nodes in an inbred ( WKY ) rat strain .
This method takes a much shorter time than the ordinary method of mouse monoclonal antibody production , because it employs only a single injection of antigen followed by collection of lymph nodes two weeks later .

These considerations led us to explore an improved method of obtaining polyclonal antibodies in a much shorter time .
This method includes production of the recombinant oligopeptide in bacteria and modification of the rat lymph node method for producing polyclonal antibodies .

This method demonstrated the following advantages : ( 1 ) a single injection of the antigen emulsion was sufficient , ( 2 ) the lymph nodes were ready for use 14 days after injection , and ( 3 ) a high yield of positive hybridomas was obtained .
--
Lymph node lymphocytes from two mice are sufficient for a single fusion attempt , and a high yield of ­positive wells is obtained .
This method saves time , effort , antigen requirements , expense , and has a better chance of success .

To reduce culture artifacts by conventional repeated passaging and long-term culture in vitro , the isolation of synovial fibroblasts ( SFB ) was attempted from rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) synovial membranes by trypsin / collagenase digest , short-term in vitro adherence ( 7 days ) , and negative isolation using magnetobead-coupled anti-CD14 monoclonal antibodies .
This method yielded highly enriched SFB ( 85 % prolyl-4-hydroxylase+ / 74 % Thy-1 / CD90+ cells ; < 2 % contaminating macrophages ; < 1 % leukocytes / endothelial cells ) that , in comparison with conventional fourth-passage RA-SFB , showed a markedly different phenotype and significantly lower proliferation rates upon stimulation with platelet-derived growth factor and IL-1β .
--
Positive isolation from primary culture with the anti-Thy-1 mAb AS02 and Dynabeads® M-450 goat anti-mouse IgG was also tested .
This method was unsuitable because : first , the percentages of contaminating macrophages were too high / variable ( 2-15 % ) ; second , the isolated SFB showed a significantly reduced surface density for Thy-1 ( MFI 19 versus 152 before isolation ; n = 4 , P ≤ 0.05 ) , presumably due to contact with the mAb used for isolation ; third , the magnetobeads remained attached to the positively isolated SFB for as long as 1 week , thus requiring further manipulation for their removal ( eg with anti-idiotypic mAbs ) ; fourth , a substantial proportion of SFB ( approximately 30 % ) was lost into the negative fraction ; and , finally , a Thy-1-dependent isolation technique bore the risk of selecting for SFB subpopulations , since the prolyl-4-hydroxylase+ cells obtained by negative isolation with Dynabeads® M-450 CD14 contained both a Thy-1+ fraction ( RA , 49.3± 14.9 % , n = 6 ; OA , 43.6 ± 12.0 % , n = 4 ) and a Thy-1- fraction , as demonstrated by double-staining FACS analysis .

In contrast , the position on the graph of the values obtained from a patient who was nonresponsive to standard therapy , whose disease severity actually increased after initiation of therapy ( values for four separate samples taken between 2 and 8 weeks after therapy are represented in Fig. 7 ) , changed in a manner that is distinct from those responding to therapy ( responders were positioned away from the active disease group towards the healthy controls in a clockwise manner , and the four values obtained from the nonresponsive patient were positioned away from the active disease group in a counterclockwise manner ) ( Fig. 7 ) .
This method of pharmacogenomic analysis therefore provides a means of developing a clinical assay that may predict patients ' response to therapy early in the course of polyarticular JRA treatment .

The protein sequence Jukes-Cantor model assigns the same probability to each substitution and is hence a rather poor approximation .
This method essentially takes the observed differences between two sequences and corrects this value to the estimated evolutionary distance using a logarithmic function .
--
Therefore , this method is well suited for generating sequences that can be recognized by both HMMER and Match , without giving an unfair disadvantage to any of the two methods .
This method was favored over inserting at random binding sites from the alignments used to generate the NWM or HMM in order to keep the training and test set separate and to evaluate the two methods based on their ability to detect sequences that are similar but not identical with the one already reported as it would be expected for novel bona fide binding sites .

The toolbox currently implements a simple alignment method utilizing the master peak list .
This method takes one peak from a peak list at a time and aligns the peak to either the best matching existing row of the master peak list or appends a new row to the master peak list , if matching row is not found for the peak .

By this strategy , we were able to provide functional clues to proteins that do not show any significant sequence or global structural similarity with proteins in the current databases .

The pair for the common corner in the new quadruplet is designated as a bulge with respect to the common corner residue .
This method of generating bulges also ensures that bulges arise from the worse scoring quadruplet .
--
The first method calculates the principal moment of the helix residues and used the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue as the helix axis .
This method thus depends only on the spread of the residues in space and does not take into account the linear connectivity of the helix residues .
--
Due to the spread of residues being more on the diametrical plane of these helices , the axis found using the eigenvector method lay closer to the plane of the diameter instead of being normal to it .
This method gave good results for longer helices .

A method here referred to as the smoother appeared in [ 9 ] .
This method , like all presented , is based on a comparison of the empirical p-value distribution to that of the uniform distribution .
--
In [ 28 ] it is suggested to estimate any empirical distribution by dividing the real axis into intervals and regarding the number of hits in each interval as the result of an inhomogeneous Poisson process , much like counting the number of cars arriving at a crossing during different time intervals .
This method was used in [ 27 ] to model the distribution of a transformed test statistic , it also appears in function locfdr which estimates a local FDR as a function of a test statistic .

--
Another way to obtain suboptimal solutions from a HMM is to do HMM sampling [ 7 ] .
This method , which consists in randomly generating parses according to the posterior probabilities , has been implemented in the gene finder SLAM .
--
Notice however that since EuGÈNE-M 's underlying model allows arbitrary alternative gene structure to be predicted , it is not limited to the prediction of such simple AS events and can perfectly cope with complex AS events , as found in mammals .
This methodology can also be integrated in other existing gene finders where the score of a gene structure is defined as the sum of elementary scores of the signals and nucleotides involved in the gene structure ( this includes HMM-based gene finders ) .

As already mentioned , selection of a QSAR model that maximizes a K2-fold CV performance estimate is common in conventional chemometrics and is also applied in proteochemometrics .

The spatial trend is estimated from these centered log-ratios .
This method helps to decrease the impact of true genomic aberrations on the detection of spatial trends in the data , particularly for samples with many , or large genomic alterations , as most of these alterations correspond to the gain or loss of whole chromosome arms .

In a previous study , we identified motifs associated with life span extension in sch9Δ , ras2Δ , and tor1Δ using a cut-off based method [ 29 ] .
This method applied the Fisher 's exact test to examine the enrichment of each motif in the up- and down-regulated gene sets from sch9Δ / wt , ras2Δ / wt , and tor1Δ / wt. Although the selection of cutoff is generally not trivial , in this case the cut-off based method and the BASE method achieve similar results .

In order to separate the effect of the method from the procedure to impute the missing values , we repeated the analysis both by filtering out all the genes with missing observations and by using the KNN method to impute them .
This method applies the novel multivariate empirical Bayes approach described in Tai et al. [ 16 ] to rank genes in the order of interest from longitudinal replicated microarray time course experiments .

The effect of the prof criterion is to delay the matching of potentially troublesome peaks such as isobaric compounds , ultimately until they exist alone in a block , at which time , the desireability of using them for alignment is evaluated by a loess-based smoothing criterion .
This method potentially can calibrate even heavily misaligned peaks since peaks are found in an adjustable search range ; we know of no other alignment algorithm for which the deviation in retention time from sample to sample can exceed the time between a peak and its neighbors [ 8 , 18 ] .

We first performed the comparison with the individual method used in ProFunc that most closely matches our own , PEAS .
This method is both conceptually and methodologically similar to our own , with the major difference being the source of the input used to build the motifs : PEAS uses the available literature on catalytic sites , which is highly desirable for accuracy but due to the current paucity of such literature is much less so for usability , while ETA instead predicts functional residues by the well-known and experimentally-validated ET approach , which we hoped would provide similar levels of accuracy and much greater availability .

Within BeadScan , the local background measures are subtracted from the bead foreground values to produce the intensities in the bead level text files .
This method is the same for all Illumina technologies .
--
An important conclusion from the spike-in experiment is that the background normalisation recommended by Illumina is not appropriate for some DE analyses .
This method is seen to introduce substantial variability into the data , particularly at low intensities , and also to increase the numbers of false positives .
--
Most analyses in this paper used the background adjusted ( see above ) , log2 transformed data from replicate beads on a given array and summarised these values using Illumina 's default method .

This method allows one to estimate jointly the dispersal curve , level of pollen immigration , selfing rate and the heterogeneity in male fertility .
--
Among the diverse methods that have been proposed for dealing with multigene data sets is the so-called supermatrix method [ 2 ] .
This method consists in concatenating the sequences of all available genes into one single " supergene " , which is then subjected to standard phylogenetic reconstruction methods .
--
For instance , one can simply eliminate the fast-evolving taxa , and replace them by slow-evolving close relatives .
This method was applied to the animal phylogeny , using 18S ribosomal RNA [ 15 ] , and led to a reappraisal of the position of nematodes .
--
I used maximum likelihood models of coding-sequence evolution [ 17 , 18 ] to test the hypothesis that functional diversification of snake venom PLA2 genes is driven by positive Darwinian selection .
This method determines the strength and direction of selection by estimating the nonsynonymous-to-synonymous substitution rate ( dN / dS = ω ) , with ω = 1 , < 1 , and > 1 indicating neutral evolution , purifying selection and directional selection , respectively .
--
Given variation in squirrel and capuchin monkey size and , consequently , in allometric shape variation associated with those size differences , a normalization technique to scale data and remove allometric effects was applied [ 20 , 24 ] .
This method , which I will refer from now on as " Multivariate Allometric Size-Scaling ( MASS ) " , is derived from theoretical equations of allometric growth removing all the information related to size , not only scaling all individuals to the same size , but also adjusting their shape to account for allometry [ 20 ] .
--
Ignoring transfers between sister taxa on average 57.7 % of the exchanges and 60 % of the donations were identified as significant conflicts .
This method could greatly be improved , if it were to consider the support values of the bipartitions not shared between the trees .
--
Computation of CLZ thus involves a decomposition of the text into repeated blocks , and an application to the discovery of structural regularities in genetic ' texts ' was realized by Gusev et al. [ 15 ] .
This method has identified arrays of conserved sequence blocks in NCS of vertebrates from fish to humans [ 16 , 17 ] .
--
Redelings and Suchard ( 2005 ) describe a statistical method of incorporating indel information into phylogeny estimation .
This method uses a joint reconstruction framework that simultaneously infers the alignment , tree , and insertion / deletion rates .
--
Joint estimation of alignment and phylogeny sidesteps bias that results from conditioning on a single alignment estimate [ 21 , 18 ] , bias which may be exaggerated when indel information is inappropriately used .
This method is based on a probabilistic model of sequence evolution that contains insertion and deletion events as well as substitution events .
--
Furthermore , each event was checked using a second method in the RDP package , SISCAN ( SSC , [ 85 ] ) .
This method conducts a sliding window analysis with a phylogenetic criterion , calculating a p-value through sequence permutation .
--
The Gu method uses a maximum-likelihood procedure to test whether there has been a significant change in the rate of evolution after gene duplication leading to the two paralogs .
This method tests for functional divergence by estimating the log-likelihood value of the hypothesis assuming a value for the coefficient of functional divergence ( θ > 0 ) and comparing this likelihood with that under the hypothesis of no functional divergence ( θ = 0 ) .
--
Alternatively , a non-phylogenetic method , applying dynamic programming that minimizes the mutation and recombination cost between sequences was used .
This method is implemented in the software Recco [ 56 ] .
--
For example , consider the evaluation method of generating synthetic data using computer simulation techniques [ 6-9 ] .
This method has many advantages including that the true phylogeny is known and large amounts of data can be generated rapidly .
--
The two haplotypes identified in the tobacco sample were also unconnected .
This method also allows for the identification of the putative ancestral haplotype based on its frequency in the population .
--
For inferring intraspecific evolution , networks of haplotypes sampled from populations of R. solani AG-3 were built using the algorithm recommended by Posada & Crandall [ 26 ] .
This method starts by estimating the maximum number or differences between haplotypes as a result of single substitutions ( i.e. , those not resulting from multiple substitutions in a single site ) with the statistical significance level of 95 % [ 59 ] .
--
Haplotypes differing by only one change are connected , and then those differing by two , three and so on until all the haplotypes are included in a single network , or until the limit of parsimony connection is reached .
This method also allows for the identification of probable recombinants through observations of spatial distribution of the sequence of homoplasies defined by the network [ 60 ] .
--
The best fitting , least-parameter rich model of sequence evolution was based on hierarchical likelihood-ratio test in the program ModelGenerator0.6 [ 61 ] .
This method identified the HKY+G model of sequence evolution and four gamma distributed rate categories as the optimal model .
--
Multiple DPCoA allows the evaluation of the impact of various loci in the measurement and description of diversity .
This method is general enough to handle a large variety of data sets .
--
The TinT information concerning relative fixation times of CR1 subtypes enabled us to efficiently investigate gamebird phylogeny and to reconstruct an unambiguous tree topology .
This method should provide a useful tool for investigations in other taxonomic groups as well .
--
In our analyses of retroposition presence / absence data , we applied the statistical test developed by Waddell et al. [ 32 ] to determine the level of statistical support for particular branching points of the galliform phylogenetic tree .
This methodology assumes the existence of a prior hypothesis based on other data , and calculates the relative probability that one of the three possible branching patterns is correct based on the number of independent retropositional markers supporting the various hypotheses .
--
Comparisons of the relative rates of development between fore- and hindlimbs within each species were made using the event-pair method .
This method encodes the relative timing between any two developmental events , with 0 indicating that event A occurred before event B , 1 indicating that both occurred simultaneously , and 2 indicating that event B occurred first .
--
For each gene family the order of branching within the phylogenetic tree was used to estimate the time window for gene duplication events relative to the divergence of major taxa of organisms .
This method of relative dating does not depend on the assumption of a constant rate of molecular evolution and is thus robust to differences in the rate of evolution in different branches of the tree [ 12 ] .
--
For example , as briefly noted above , each node in the tree can have a prior distribution representing knowledge of its date .
This method of calibrating a tree based on specifying the date of one of the nodes has a long history [ 35 ] .
--
First , net among clade divergence ( [ 30 ] p. 276 ) ± standard error corrected with a TN model [ 76 ] of nucleotide substitution was calculated in MEGA3 [ 77 ] .
This method subtracts the intraspecific diversity from overall divergence between two species and is unbiased when lineages are reciprocally monophyletic and ancestral population sizes is equal to the average of the two descendent species [ reviewed in [ 78 ] ] .
--
This was done by the split decomposition method in SplitsTree , version 2.4 [ 40 ] , using pairwise distances under the Kimura 3-ST model [ 72 ] .
This method visualizes recombination events by depicting the shortest pathway linking sequences , rather than forcing them into a bifurcating tree [ 39 , 40 ] .
--
We looked at the stability of this clade by reducing noise in the data set using site-stripping .
This method systematically RY-codes or removes the most variable nucleotide sites ( scored as the average of their consistency and retention indices ) and then re-runs MrBayes ( [ 38 ] and see methods section below ) .
--
The temporal method allows to estimate the effective population size through the analysis of the variation in the allele frequencies of temporally spaced samples of a given population [ 41 ] .
This method calculates the standardized variance in the temporal changes of allele frequency F , which is reciprocally proportional to the effective population size .
--
As the most likely number of clusters present in a dataset is not necessarily indicated by the highest lnP ( D ) ( see STRUCTURE manual for additional details ) we applied the method of Evanno et al. [ 68 ] to approach the most likely number of clusters K .
This method looks for a maximum of the slope ( ΔK ) of the lnP ( D ) distribution among runs .
--
If so , we factorize the current l optimally , and make a desirable jump in the search space that would otherwise have been impossible .
This method will be referred to as the combined method .
--
Unlike other infectious diseases , vector-borne diseases stand out because of their complex mode of transmission , requiring the transition from man to man or animal to man through an arthropod vector .
This method of transmission implies the simple principle that removal of the vector will lead to the elimination of the disease [ 1 ] .
--
A second and more powerful method to detect selection was also applied .
This method detects elevated dN / dS ratios ( ω ratios ) using maximum likelihood approaches ( see Yang 2007 ) and is less conservative than the McDonald-Kreitman test .
--
We therefore used a codon by codon maximum likelihood test , to ask if we could detect any codons that have been under repeated , strong positive selection .
This method allows a site by site analysis , thus the identification of particular codons that have been evolving under selective constrains [ 40 ] is feasible .
--
The analysis was carried out with Diverge ( version 2.0 ) [ 28 ] .
This method is based on maximum likelihood procedures to estimate significant changes in the rate of evolution after the emergence of two paralogous sequences .
--
We analysed the resolved MHP phylogeny ( Figure 3a ) , and identified in total 4 duplication events and 4 losses .
This method over prescribes gene losses as in the case of EPO , where the sequence data was not available and therefore is assumed to be a loss .
--
Our results show differential retention and loss in the LPO lineage following this gene duplication event resulting in the cow species retaining an alternative duplicate copy to the other mammals in the dataset , as shown in Figure 3b .
This method must be used with caution as it does not take into account rate heterogeneity amongst species or sites in the data , and relies solely on the topology .
--
Up to three individuals of each species ( depending on the number available ) were cleared with trypsin and double-stained using alcian-blue ( cartilage ) and alizarin-red ( bone ) .
This method allows clear visualization of the skeletal components while maintaining skull articulations [ 27 ] .
--
We used a recently developed method to estimate the DDME from nucleotide diversity data of two species ( C. elegans and C. remanei ) that exhibit strikingly different Ne [ 23 , 50 ] .
This method was applied to 730 Kbp of shotgun sequencing-based diversity data from four wild strains of C. elegans that were compared to the genome sequence of Bristol N2 [ 51 ] and diversity data from 40 X-linked loci in C. remanei [ 52 ] .
--
In D. melanogaster , a promising line for the study of additive genetic variation is hemiclonal analysis ( members of a single hemiclone share a random genomic haplotype ) [ 27 ] .
This methodology presents some important strengths including that it virtually screens the entire genome , and that measures of genetic variation are devoid of maternal effects , dominance , and practically epistatic variation [ 27 ] .
--
Nuclear gene genealogy is a powerful tool to examine the historical interaction between sperm-dependent unisexuals and their sexual sperm donors .
This methodology could be applicable to many other unisexual lineages to improve our understanding of their reproduction and their ability to persist .
--
Evidence of positive selection was sought using a codon-based approach as implemented in Datamonkey [ 68 ] .
This method does not need to assume equal synonymous substitution rates throughout the sequence and allows to choose the most appropriate model for nucleotide substitution .
--
However , this method is only capable of determining the rate between two subtypes where a third , more distantly related , subtype functions as an outgroup .
This method thus trades the ad hoc rate assumptions of the previous methods with two implicit conditions : ( i ) that subtypes have a unique divergence and ( ii ) a third , comparable subtype is available to serve as an outgroup .
--
Glycosyltransferases have been classified into 90 groups based on amino acid sequence similarity by Coutinho et al. [ 30 ] and are listed in the CAZy web site [ 31 ] .
This method of classification also reflects the molecular mechanism of catalysis within a given family .
To the summary statistic approaches we added the coalescence-based maximum-likelihood method of Galtier et al. [ 16 ] .
This method is designed to detect a distortion in the shape of gene genealogies generated by a diversity-reducing event ( hitchhiking or bottleneck ) .
--
First , changes over time in nonparametric estimates of the effective population size of N. taihuensis were evaluated with the skyline plots [ 38 , 39 ] using R 2.6.1 [ 97 ] .
This method can provide a rough profile of population demographic fluctuation , and can be used as a model selection tool .
--
A straight forward way to estimate the age of a particular " root " haplotype , given the mutation rate , is to consider all available descendant individual sequences and take the arithmetic mean over all distances to the root haplotype .
This method is referred to as " rho " estimation [ 33 ] and can be performed using the freely available software package Network .
--
We used the ' fossil cross-validation ' method to measure the agreement between these different calibration points [ 17 ] .
This method compares the difference between the fossil and molecular ages by rerunning the PL analysis with single calibration nodes .
--
In addition , we used the rarefaction method of Petit et al. [ 41 ] to correct for the difference in the number of genes sampled in the two species .
This method estimates the number of alleles that would be observed in an equal sample of genes from multiple groups based on the number of alleles observed in the actual unequal samples obtained .
--
Here , we describe a method to reveal the ability of evolutionary models to account for the compositional heterogeneity in a sequence alignment , which we measure using the median of all Bowker 's pairwise statistics , or the number of significant Bowker 's pairwise tests ( in the following , we note the measure of compositional heterogeneity h ) .
This method is tree-based , and uses parametric bootstrapping [ 10-12 ] .
--
Examples include conserved domains IV and V in the FoxA cluster and the transactivation domain in the FoxI cluster ( Figure 2A , C , see Additional file 3 ( A , C ) ) .
This method identifies a region of amino acids that are less likely to be important for a specific function , which may then be examined last for functional significance when using in vitro methods .
--
Since the latter method allows for direct computation of the thresholds for all traits , whereas the simulation required significant computing time for each trait , we used the thresholds obtained using the effective number of markers .
This method calculates the number of independent tests in a genome or chromosome scan and uses the " effective number of markers " in a Bonferonni correction .
--
Moreover , elimination of a small number of sites ( 12-18 % for our three datasets ) , particularly for introns and concatenation of markers , allows for increase in the support for deeper nodes .
This method can effectively be useful because the deepest phylogenetic relationships , characterized by short internal branches , are very often the most difficult to resolve .
--
Normalizing by joint entropy combats this : the pairs will have equal NMI .
This method was reimplemented based on the description in [ 21 ] .
--
We compared the results considering each taxon as a separate lineage , and using a pre-defined guide tree to allow rates to be compared between different supra-specific clades ( using the 18S rRNA topology of Meland & Willassen 2007 [ 6 ] ) .
This method has been used to identify fast-clock organisms for exclusion from phylogenetic analyses [ 44 , 45 ] .
--
Phylogenetically independent contrasts ( PIC ) analyses were performed using the programs PDAP 1.09 [ 33 ] and Mesquite 1.12 [ 34 ] in order to search for significant correlations between the biomechanical parameters calculated by JawsModel4 .
This method was used to reduce the effect of common descent on patterns of correlation between biomechanical variables [ 35 ] .
--
It has been shown that using codon-based models can improve phylogenetic inference from protein-coding genes [ 67 ] .
This method is computationally intensive , thus precluding the computation of bootstrap values for a dataset of 49 species .
--
To control for the possible effect of common phylogenetic descent , we used Felsenstein 's [ 45 ] independent comparison method as implemented in the computer program PDAP ( Vers. 6.0 , module PDTREE ) by Garland et al. [ 46 ] and Garland & Ives [ 47 ] .
This method finds a set of independent pair-wise differences or contrasts , assuming that changes along the branches of the phylogeny can be modelled by a Brownian motion process ( successive changes are independent of one another ) , and that the expected total change over many independent changes is zero [ 48 ] .
--
Finally , columns name-id and parent-name-id in the table NODE are used by the ' Connect By ' clause ( see Additional file 1 , Query 3 ) .
This method uses the hierarchical relationship modelled as a self-referencing relation .
--
To classify our sequences into families , we used a nucleotide sequence identity matrix built using pairwise deletion method ( see Additional file 1 ) .
This method presents the advantage to compute a distance for each pair of sequences , ignoring only the gaps that are involved in the comparison and therefore including the largest amount of information for the whole dataset .
This method appears as the most appropriate to analyze our sequences , as our dataset is constituted of several PCR-based sequences that only partially overlap , and because many of our sequences harbor small internal indels .
--
To estimate the level of functional divergence and predict important amino acid residues for these functional differences among OPR subfamilies , the coefficients of type-I and type-II functional divergence ( θI and θII ) between any two clusters were calculated for each position in the alignment ( Additional file 3 ) , using the method suggested by Gu et. al. ( 1999 , 2006 ) [ 38 , 77 ] , as implemented in the DIVERGE v2.0 package [ 36 ] .
This method is based on maximum likelihood procedures to estimate significant changes in the site-specific shift of evolutionary rate or site-specific shift of amino acid properties after the emergence of two paralogous sequences .
--
We also analyzed the combined Ourisia AFLP dataset using PCO-MC , a recently published method [ 65 ] which couples principal coordinate analysis ( PCO ) with a clustering procedure to determine significant population structure .
This method offers an objective way to determine whether clusters found in the PCO are significant , and it simultaneously takes into consideration many or all of the axes that explain the variation in a dataset ( as opposed to only the first three that can be easily visualised [ 65 ] ) .
--
As described previously in Steiger et al. ( 2008 ) [ 19 ] , a nonparametric estimation technique applying the concept of ' sample coverage " [ 34 ] was used to estimate the total number of OR genes in each genome investigated .
This method estimates the total number of OR genes from an incomplete sampling of OR genes ( achieved via PCR ) .
--
In a second step , we chose the appropriate coverage estimator ( ACE1 ) given the information provided by C and CV .
This method does not assume an equal probability for each gene to be cloned and thus accounts for primer bias .
--
We have also developed a self-directed blended e-learning program that allows learners electronic access to video-rich clinical challenges before and after face-to-face training .
This method has potentially wide applicability at low cost , and may assist in maintaining change .
--
We used actual patients to elicit arguments and thoughts of the GPs derived from practice , and not from general professional ideas .
This method is relatively new and may encourage more relevant results than a more open interview method .
--
However , the patients were representative for long-term sick-listed persons in relation to age and gender .
This method for functional assessment is quite time-consuming compared to a normal GP consultation in busy and ordinary practice , which is estimated to last for 10-20 minutes .
--
The National Primary Care Development Team is measuring access as part of the adoption of the system of ' Advanced Access ' , a system developed in the USA [ 18 , 19 ] , as a response to patient waiting times of 4 - 6 weeks for routine appointments in primary care [ 20 ] .
This method collects data on one day per week ( which can vary ) at 12 noon .
--
A follow up letter was sent if no response was received after 2 weeks .
This method of selection was as inclusive as possible and allowed no room for subjectivity based on previous control or compliance .
--
The ACE-I dosages were first converted to standardised dosages according to target daily doses for heart failure as recommended in the Dutch desk reference book [ 14 ] .
This method of standardisation , which has been used before , uses 20 mg of enalapril as reference dose [ 15 ] .
--
If all three components were found , the response was coded as completely correct .
This method of coding , although not previously validated , offered useful detail regarding the completeness of the participants ' comprehension .
--
The methodology developed for use in analysing industrial accidents has been adapted for use in a healthcare setting , classifying ' error producing circumstances ' and ' organisational factors ' in a single broad framework of factors affecting clinical practice [ 16 ] .
This method was previously used in a similar study of UK general practitioners and involves inviting comments about the cause of delayed diagnosis and summarising the discussion on a white board and recording comments verbatim [ 17 ] .
--
Analysis of the interviews was undertaken using the framework approach outlined by Pope et al and Ritchie and Spencer [ 31 , 32 ] .
This method was chosen due to time restraints and because this method is often used in health policy research contexts [ 33 ] .
--
A multiple logistic regression model with backward selection ( criterion : p-value to remove ≥ 0.10 ) was used to estimate the simultaneous effect of several determinants of neuropathy ( PN ) and peripheral vascular disease ( PVD ) among the sample population .
This method first enters all independent variables selected by the researcher in the logistic equation and then sequentially removes them , starting with the least significant one , until all p-values are below the chosen value 0.10 ( p-value to remove ) .
--
In accordance with other studies , we used log-files from the ELP software provider as an outcome measure [ 21 ] .
This methodology ensures that our data are complete and correct and that the proportion of participants can thus be considered to be accurate .
--
One medical record was not available for examination , as this patient had not given permission .
This method generated between one or two events per ten deceased patients .
--
Inaccuracies of medical record are well documented [ 17 ] .
This method generated different types of adverse events , although the number in diagnostic events was rather low .
--
These results give an idea of the " normal " working method of the GP .
This method of data collection makes it possible to examine such large numbers of patients from different sex and age groups [ 22 ] .
--
Such a difference could , in part , have two explanantions : 1. instead of the traditional tissue sections , we have used the more sensitive HEp-2 cells as IFL substrate for ANA screening .
This methodological approach could account for a higher ANA prevalence , in spite of the different starting serum dilution ( 1 : 80 rather than 1.40 ) .
--
The relative performance of the four IBDQ dimensions in distinguishing best patients with minor symptoms from those with severe , was studied by discriminant analysis .

It is propelled by peristalsis and disposable .
This method , first described by Iddan et al [ 7 ] , is now widespread and has revolutionized the visualisation of small intestinal mucosa .
--
Each simulation included 32 individuals per population , 16 populations , 27 loci and an expected FST of 0.078 .
This method provides evidence for divergent selection by looking for outliers with FST values higher than expected , controlling for heterozygosity [ 22 ] .
--
In some instances , a subsection of 20 SNPs in the region of a possible location was created as a framework map ; MultiMap [ 45 ] was then able to place such SNPs .
This methodology was continued until : a ) - no further SNPs were placed into a unique position , b ) - Proposed alternative placements suggested by MultiMap [ 45 ] numbered greater than three , or c ) - a SNP was placed at both ends of a chromosome .
--
This data structure seemed ideal to explore the usefulness of simultaneous equations for detailed deconstruction of complex phenotypes .
This methodology , however , will need to overcome the challenges of defining robust structural models in the absence of knowledge of the underlying system .
--
A new regression-based method of linkage analysis that works on arbitrary pedigrees has recently been published [ 2 ] and implemented in the publicly available MERLIN software package [ 3 ] .
This method promises to be robust with respect to departures from normality , a problem that has plagued variance components linkage analysis [ 4 ] .
--
Linkage analyses were conducted using the variance components analysis method as implemented in the SOLAR program [ 2 ] .
This method evaluates linkage by comparing a variance component model that permits a particular locus to account for some of the additive genetic variance ( along with a residual polygenic component ) to a purely polygenic model by using likelihood ratio tests .
--
Liang et al. [ 5 ] developed a multipoint linkage mapping approach for estimating the location of a trait locus using affected sibling pairs .
This method makes an assumption that there is no more than one trait locus in the chromosomal region .

Variance-component univariate linkage analysis implemented in SOLAR ( 1.7.4 ) [ 8 ] was used for heritability estimation , and two-point and multipoint linkage analyses .
This method is based on the assumption of a multivariate normal distribution for the traits tested , and a violation of the assumption may result in inflated type I error rates [ 9 , 10 ] .
--
Data from fixed effects such as sex or population can also be incorporated .
This methodology has been the basis of many national and international animal breeding programs , where in its most complete implementation it is referred to as the animal model [ 3 ] .

--
With the help of a metal comb , eggs , nits and adults were collected under water and immediately transferred into 95 % alcohol .
This method of collecting lice preludes any sampling bias favouring larger females over smaller males as suggested by Nuttall and Marshall [ 37 ] .
--
Since the vast majority ( 59 of 62 , 95 % ) of our multiplex families were nuclear families with two or more affected siblings , but no other affected relative pairs , we used the nonparametric MLS method for affected sibling pair data [ 76 ] to compute family-specific lod scores .
This method has been implemented in the program SIBLINK [ 77 ] .
--
The most commonly used approach is implementation of the expectation-maximization ( EM ) algorithm [ 10 ] .
This method is computationally intensive and is usually combined with various strategies to simplify the task ( i.e. , by considering only subsets of the sites at a time ) or to minimize the number of potential haplotypes that must be considered [ 11 , 12 ] .

Linkage analysis with microsatellite markers was performed using a nonparametric allele-sharing method [ 6 ] implemented in software ALLEGRO [ 7 ] in each of the 10 replicates and also in the pooled data .
This method evaluates linkage by testing excessive IBD sharing within affected relatives .
--
We then combined the results of the 10 primary genome scans using Fisher 's method of combining p-values [ 4 ] .
This method is based on the observation that if n independent tests are made of the same hypothesis , then we can calculate a combined p-value for all n tests by , where pi is the significance level for study i .
--
To account for the non-independence between these SNPs , a spectral decomposition method was used to obtain the effective number of independent SNPs [ 10 ] .
This method has been implemented in the software SNPSpD . SNPs with allele frequency less than 5 % were excluded from the analysis .
--
Each of these groups was then analyzed with the computer program STRUCTURE to identify possible sub-structure in the sample of 286 unrelated individuals [ 6 ] .
This method assumes that the sample contains a mixture of subpopulations and that within each subpopulation there is Hardy-Weinberg and linkage equilibrium between markers .
--
Recently , a simpler method to determine the significance level for SNP association studies has been proposed that relies on the linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) structure of the genome to determine the number of independent tests [ 1 ] .
This method uses principal components ( PC ) on pair-wise LD measures to determine the number of independent tests and uses this number as the denominator in a Bonferroni correction to the unadjusted p-values .
--
In this paper we present several applications of extensions of the method of Molitor et al. [ 1 ] .
This method is itself based on ideas introduced by Georgy Voronoi at the turn of the last century [ 2 ] .
--
We also expected that CIs based on the GEE estimator of location would be narrower than the Zlr-bootstrap CIs because the GEE method jointly models the IBD sharing pattern at all markers .
This method also assumes that there is exactly one disease gene located within the chromosome , which may improve performance when , as in the GAW14 data , this assumption is satisfied .
--
However , the extent to which this occurs is not known .
This method can also be used to investigate so-called " spurious " peaks that occur at the ends of chromosomes .
--
This nonparametric approach is based on the difference of LOD score of the likelihood under the null and alternative hypothesis , where likelihoods are computed under a multivariate normality assumption of the trait under study .
This method is known to have optimal power when the model is well specified [ 2 ] but is also known as lacking robustness to the normality assumption of the trait [ 3 ] .
--
Heritability estimates and evidence for linkage were obtained using the variance components approach implemented in SOLAR version 2.1.2 [ 7 ] .
This method partitions the total phenotypic variance into variation due to a major QTL , polygenic background , and random error .

This method yielded an average of 150 , 170 , 150 , and 180 ASPs for the AI , DA , KA , and NYC populations , respectively .

Another issue with this method of identifying double recombinants is that if a single recombinant occurs in both siblings , and the recombinant occurs on one side of a given marker in the first sibling and on the other side of that marker in the second sibling , the two siblings could in fact share an additional allele IBD for only that single marker .
This method would have no way of distinguishing between a double recombinant and two single recombinants occurring in almost the exact same chromosomal region in two individual siblings and may account for some of the false positives that have been encountered .

The original Haseman-Elston method [ 6 ] is a general model-free method for testing linkage between candidate markers and quantitative trait loci on a sample of sib-pairs .
This method involves the regression of the squared trait difference D2 = ( X1 - X2 ) 2 ) in pairs of siblings on the number of alleles shared IBD between each sib pair at a given marker .

The test statistic , a score function , in large samples is defined as : Z = ∑ij Tij ( Xij - E ( Xij ) ) / Var ( S ) 1 / 2 ~ N ( 0 , 1 ) , where E ( Xij ) is the expected value of the coding function for the offspring genotype , conditional on the parental genotype and parental / offspring phenotypes , which are assumed to follow Mendelian segregation under the null hypothesis .
This methodology extends readily to scenarios in which the parental genotypes are not known , using the approach of Rabinowitz and Laird [ 9 ] .

Heritability is defined as the proportion of the total variance attributable to the genetic effect being tested .

Slager and Schaid [ 7 ] extended the original CA trend test to case-control studies with family data , in which they modeled the correlations among related cases or controls as functions of the probability of their marker alleles shared identically by descent ( IBD ) .
This method can be applied to complex family structures and it obtains different correlations for different types of relative pairs .
--
This involved the individual genotype as a whole and the individual 's status being shuffled .
This method preserves the correlation between SNPs ( LD ) while breaking the relation between status and the genotypes .

Thus we found the SNP combination that preserves the marginal haplotype frequencies .
This method is implemented in the STRATEGY software .

This method is very useful for rapid isolation and sequencing of gene families from BAC libraries .
--
After we obtained partial sequences of the coding regions of LMW-GS genes from individual BAC clones using the universal primers , we first tried to perform primer walking using BAC DNA as template and specific primers close to the end the known sequence obtained .
This method worked well for BAC clones containing single LMW-GS gene in many cases , but not for BAC clones containing two or more LMW-GS genes ( data not shown ) .
--
Thirdly , we designed primers based on 5 ' and 3 ' terminal sequences of the known LMW-GS gene sequence [ GenBank : X13306 ] [ 19 ] combined with the above mentioned specific primers in order to generate PCR fragments from these BAC clones by primer-template mismatches .
This method did not work for all BAC clones even though we optimized PCR conditions by decreasing the concentration of Mg+2 or / and using different annealing temperatures .
--
We regularly use BAC pool screening to identify BAC clones from our library .
This method is quite efficient for single or low copy target .

This consisted of selecting pairs for which the observed number of subjects having one of the four joint homozygote genotypes ( AA-AA , AA-BB , BB-AA or BB-BB ) differed from that which would be expected from the separate genotype frequencies by a particular threshold value of z based on a binomial expectation , where z = ( O-E ) / √E with O being the observed count and E the expected count .

Analysis points were at mid-marker values .
This method is very similar to the method above , but accounts for the binary nature of the si data in Step 2 of the VCs analysis , by using a Generalised Linear Model ( GLM ) with the logit link function [ 37 ] , i.e. Logit ( si ) = μ + wi + ui + vip + vim .
--
The likelihood ratio test was calculated as above .
This method is very similar to TDS-lin , but the binary nature of the data is accounted for by a GLM using the logit link function , i.e. the model is : Logit ( Sij ) = μ+ wi + dayj + ui + vip + vim .

Here , I present a method for computing the power of a genome-wide association study when a genetic model and sample size are specified and LD information is available for the population being studied .
This method is equivalent to the cumulative r2 adjusted power of Jorgenson and Witte [ 17 ] , which will be referred to as " power " for brevity .
--
This final equation is the same as taking the average power over all the SNPs .
This method was applied to examine the power of genome-wide association studies in the four populations studied in the International HapMap Project [ 19 ] .
--
While this approach has been used successfully [ 6 ] , others have suggested that greater power can be obtained by looking at multiple tags or haplotypes [ 18 , 20 ] .
This method for computing power can be adapted to such strategies provided it is possible to compute the power of detecting each SNP in the population given the set of tagging SNPs .

Other methods that have been implemented are to adjust the lipid levels for medication by using medications as covariates in a linear regression model .
This method tends to minimize the differences in lipid levels between medicated and unmedicated groups , but not necessarily adjust lipid levels toward their original values .
--
First , we removed those on medication from the analysis ( annotated bp-med ) .
This method of accounting for medication was used in the previous study of blood pressure in this population [ 13 ] and was chosen because anecdotal evidence suggest that compliance to prescription guidelines are not rigid in the OOA community and members tend not to control their blood pressure tightly with medication .
--
Based on the effects of anti-hypertensive medication from a double blind randomized controlled trial [ 24 ] , Cui et al. ( 2003 ) recommend adding a constant of 10 mmHg to SBP and 5 mmHg to DBP to the observed blood pressures of those on medication [ 19 ] .
This method of adjustment for medication has been demonstrated to perform well in a range of realistic clinical scenarios [ 20 ] .

Results from the integration of Bayesian tests and other machine learning techniques with linkage disequilibrium data suggest that we do not need to use too stringent thresholds to reduce the number of false positive associations .
This method yields increased power even with relatively small samples .
--
We propose to work with scan statistics as previously developed [ 21 ] .
This method also employs a window of a fixed length ( fixed number of SNPs ) and determines the maximum of the sum of test statistics for all such windows in the genome , which is the scan statistic of the given length .

This method was described as a reference method by Santé and Fernandez [ 22 ] .
At 24 h post mortem , the ultimate pH of meat ( pHu ) was recorded by direct insertion of the xerolyte electrode in the muscle .
This method was adopted because of the significant correlation obtained 24 h post mortem between the direct tissue measurement of pH and the reference " iodoacetate " method [ 22 ] .
--
Model fitting is based on the EM algorithm , and iterative proportional fitting , with parameter starting values defined via a random number seed .
This method of fitting yields maximum likelihood estimates of the model parameters , which are therefore unbiased in large samples , and have the smallest possible variance .
--
We first identify the SNPs in strong LD with an associated SNP as measured by the correlation coefficient r2 in the initial population ; when r2 is reduced in a second population , we then have the opportunity to refine the association and filter out some of the originally correlated variants .
This method presumes that the mechanism of action for functional genetic variants is shared in common across human populations , although differences in allele frequencies at risk loci can lead to differences in prevalence .

A useful way of discovering SNP 's in non-model organisms is by designing primers in exons in a species with considerable genomic data to amplify the corresponding exon ( or intron ) in a species with limited genetic data ( i.e. the EPIC approach , [ 20 , 21 ] ) .
This method has for example been used to amplify 242 introns in several diverse avian species by designing primers in conserved regions between the chicken genome sequence and orthologous zebra finch sequences [ 3 ] .
--
We demonstrate the utility of this method on four examples comprised of one non-coding data set and three coding data sets .

In breast cancer , we find that the members of two TF families , the steroid nuclear receptor and the ATF / CREB families , are significantly associated with patient survival .
This method can also be used to identify transcription factors associated with a specific cancer subtype .
--
BASE was the method used in this study to infer the relationship between TFs and the survival probability of patients with different cancer types .
This method makes use of gene expression data and TF-gene binding affinities .
The intuition behind this method is that if a TF is related to the survival outcome of a patient given a certain disease , then the genes that are regulated by this TF will be more differentially expressed between the patients that survive or die .
This method is substantially different from finding a correlation , such as Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficients , between gene expression and binding affinity .

We have developed a method for generating large numbers of competent antigen presenting cells from deer mouse bone marrow using house mouse GM-CSF .
This method resulted in the production of antigen-specific T cell lines from outbred deer mice .
Inclusion of antigen-specific antibody in cultures augments T cell proliferation , suggesting the APC express Fc receptors .
This method will allow characterization of APC and T cells in deer mice and may be extended to other rodent species that are important in infectious disease research .

Since the main purpose of this work was to compare methods of leukocyte enumeration , these factors were not taken into account .
This methodology is not restricted to the image analysis package we used to obtain the data reported in the present work .
--
Quantitative RT-PCR was used to determine the gene expression profile for P2 receptors .
This method was selected because selective agonists and antagonists for most of the P2 receptor subtypes are absent and real-time PCR has advantages over other methods , such as requiring only a small number of cells and being one of the most reliable methods of determining the amount of RNA .

--
In the clinical situation larger volumes of CSF are usually available from patients , which may further shorten the detection time .
This method is particularly well suited in situations where CSF volumes are limited ( e.g. in newborns and infants ) .
--
In our case , because follow-up visits took place months apart , we decided against such an assumption , and instead treated observations of stage 2 progression as interval-censored , i.e. considered simply that progression had occurred within a time interval defined by the visit when stage 2 was confirmed and the previous visit ( when it was known that the patient had not yet progressed ) .
This method implies likelihood expressions that are somewhat different from the right censoring case [ 16 ] and a user-defined Stata module for interval-censored survival analysis was applied [ 17 ] .

We also utilised a powerful statistical test developed by Slager and Schaid ( 2001 ) [ 30 ] , which involves comparing genotype frequencies of genetically related cases ( sampled from multiplex affected families ) with the unrelated control group frequencies .
This method is based on the Armitage test for trend and includes a variance estimate that appropriately accounts for the non-independence of related cases .
--
Temporal autocorrelation was estimated using the first-order autoregressive ( AR1 ) method on suprathreshold voxels .
This method estimates the actual autocorrelation from the fMRI time series rather than imposing a generic temporal smoothing filter ( see [ 49 ] for further discussion ) .
--
Recently , Franke et al. [ 73 ] developed a Bayesian approach to reconstruct a functional human gene network that integrates information on genes and the functional relationships between them , based on data from multiple sources ( the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes , the Biomolecular Interaction Network Database , and so on ) .
This method can help ' prioritize ' , in a first-stage analysis , candidate genes and gene-gene interactions associated with a specific disease , which could then be validated in an independent sample using the partitioning methods studied in our paper .
--
An alternative approach to correct for multiple testing could be to use permutation testing and assess the distribution of a maximum test statistic or minimum P-value after repeating the entire two-stage procedure n times ( for example with n = 1,000 ) [ 74 , 75 ] .
This method , which was applied to our data , also appears conservative compared to FDR adjustment but has the advantage of being very general .

They were also distributed in a survey , by email or fax , to a similar non-participant group .
This method was chosen as an adaptation for an online format with automated data transfer of the case vignette assessment method that has been recognized for its value in predicting physician practice patterns ; results from recent research demonstrate case vignettes , compared with other processes of care measures such as chart review and standardized patients , are a valid and comprehensive method to measure a physician 's processes of care [ 20 , 21 ] .
--
1. Secondary digitization of a primary analogous image e.g. a conventional radiographic film and subsequent electronic transfer transfer to the teaching file .
This method is rather time-consuming and implies loss of image quality due to digitization , but is typically required when external radiographs or slides are included ; the additional effort must be weighed against the relevance for the case presentation on an individual basis .
--
The direct digital transfer is - with respect to workflow integration and image quality - obviously the most attractive method and is the preferred way in the context of the establishment of PACS .
This method becomes even more relevant , because the number of images per case is increasing continuously due to sophisticated radiological techniques .
--
The basic experiential method invites students to engage in an experience , to create some learning from it , and then through a process of structured reflection to identify what it is that each has learned and to apply this new knowledge thereby expanding the repertoire of possible solutions .
This method is designed to aid the review and exploration of attitudes and assumptions , discovery of differences , and consideration of the implications of personal attitudes and emotions for professional behaviour and communication .
--
The problem of the arbitrariness of dimensions can be circumvented by means of a variant of MDS known as INDSCAL ( Individual Differences Scaling ) [ 44 , 45 ] .
This method analyses the similarity matrices either of individual subjects or of groups of subjects who are likely to differ , so that , for instance , one might have groups based on sex and age , the presumption being that older students may have different career preferences from their younger peers , and female students may have different preferences from their male peers .
--
This approach assists in the generalisability of the findings [ 22 ] and offers evidence more convincingly ( but not in a statistical significant sense ) than relying on anecdotal accounts alone .
This method can also contribute to the validation and credibility of qualitative research [ 22-24 ] .

--
Demographic data collected included gender , age group ( 30-40 , 41-55 , > 56 years ) , employment contract ( salaried staff specialist or contracting visiting medical officer ) , and the speciality of the clinician ( internist , surgeon , or other sub-specialist - pathologists , radiologists , psychiatrists etc. ) .
This method was chosen as the assessment and statistical method for the study as it combines qualitative and quantitative research traditions [ 12 ] ( accessed 07 / 06 / 2005 ) .

The analytic methodology used in this study was based on de- and re-contextualisation of data by coding , categorizing , and memo writing [ 21 , 23 ] .
This methodology is described by Crabtree and Miller as the " hermeneutic editing " approach to data analysis [ 25 ] .

It was done over two days so that the students could assimilate the lecture content before going on to the other three components [ 5 ] .
This method allowed students to listen , read , discuss and solve problems in a large group format for every endocrine gland .
--
Historically , the Halstedian method of " see one , do one and teach one " has been the method of choice for teaching surgery residents how to perform procedures .
This method of teaching increases operating room time , use of equipment and human resources [ 23 ] .
--
As responses were received , volunteers were allocated by a process of alternation to one of three groups , until the approximate capacity of the room used for face-to-face teaching was reached , at which point , the remaining students were allocated to the computer lab for Web-based teaching .
This method of allocation was acceptable since concealment of the teaching format is regarded as more important than the actual method of participant assignment [ 10 ] and participants were allocated by one of the authors ( SFS ) who does not teach final year students and therefore had no personal knowledge of these students ' abilities or interests .
--
Traditionally this has been in the form of summative assessment such as an end-of-course barrier examination .
This method focuses students ' minds towards a single goal , but tends to foster rote learning with the inevitable " is this going to be in the exam " approach to the choice of material studied .
--
The method of interpretation used was inspired by the French philosopher Paul Ricoeur 's phenomenological hermeneutics [ 26 ] , and developed at the University of Tromsø ( Norway ) and Umeå University ( Sweden ) and has previously been used by Lindseth et al. , [ 27 ] Udén et al. , [ 1 , 28 ] Søderberg and Norberg. , [ 29 ] Sørlie et al. , [ 18 , 30-33 ] and Nordam et al.

There are no major problems with this pattern of ART since both the sperm and eggs used are those of the concerned couple , and it is the wife of the concerned couple who gives birth .
This method is similar to AIH , but the mechanical action of in vitro fertilization intervenes .
--
The quantitative component of the study assumed the format of a descriptive survey of RECs in South Africa that was based on a structured questionnaire .
This method ensured that each REC was exposed to the same questions so that their responses could be reliably compared [ 11 ] .
--
The questionnaire was completed with the assistance of the interviewer .
This method of face-to-face completion of structured questionnaires enabled the form to be completed comprehensively [ 11 ] .
--
The SNaPshot technique is particularly well-suited for the screening of mitochondrial DNA variants for the following reasons : i ) the short intron-less mitochondrial genes means that the entire gene can be PCR-amplified and screened in a single PCR fragment and ii ) homoplasmic mutations ( such as the ones investigated in the present study ) are represented as a single peak at each locus which simplifies the analysis .
This method is also less labour-intensive and less prone to false positives compared to the other methods reported to date .
--
The method was constructed from two procedures : 1 ) a fluorescent labeling reaction of PCR fragments using fluorescence-adapted primers in a single tube , and 2 ) electrophoresis on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel .
This method was more economical and convenient than the single-stranded conformational polymorphism ( SSCP ) methods previously reported in the detection of the labeled fragments obtained .
--
Single-stranded conformational polymorphism ( SSCP ) analysis has been widely applied to detect SNPs , including point mutations in cancer and congenital diseases [ 1-4 ] .
This method has been modified to detect signals by use of radio isotope-labeled PCR fragments , detection of PCR fragments by silver staining , PCR using fluorescent labeled primers , and fluorescent internal labeling of PCR fragments [ 5-10 ] .
--
In this study , we introduce an improved RSP assay to detect this polymorphism .
This method included newly designed primers and only one round of PCR amplification which yields one short and specific APOC1 fragment followed by HpaI digestion .
--
The H2 allele frequency in the black subjects ( 0.350 ) was significantly ( p = 0.024 ) higher than that in the white subjects ( 0.177 ) .
This method was more economical and convenient than the methods previously reported to detect this mutation in the APOC1 gene .
--
Although our primary analytic methods will focus on the concordant pair design , we will also use a complementary and related approach , the discordant sibling pair method .

The nested-PCR fragments from PKD1 cDNA showing no abnormality in size were further screened for mutation by a multiple restriction fragment-single strand conformation polymorphism ( MRF-SSCP ) method .
This method firstly developed by Lee et al. [ 21 ] was modified to use silver staining instead of radioactive detection .
--
The MRF-SSCP technique has been developed and preliminarily used for screening other types of mutations .
This method is able to screen mutation in a long cDNA fragment ( > 1 kb ) amplified by nested PCR and it is feasible to use for mutation screening in the entire sequence of PKD1 cDNA , reducing the numbers of PCR reactions and SSCP gels required for the analysis .
--
The human NAT2*4 , NAT2*5A , NAT2*5B , NAT2*5C , NAT2*6A and NAT2*7B alleles were identified by genotyping using the PCR-RFLP method of Hickman & Sim [ 30 ] , and Hickman et al. [ 31 ] .
This method is more than 95 % accurate at predicting the NAT2 phenotype in a Caucasian population [ 31 ] .
This method of genotyping is unable to distinguish between the NAT2*4 / NAT2*5B and the NAT2*5A / NAT2*5C genotypes .
The algorithm uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to select at random a value from the distribution of the possible values predicted by the missing value model .
This method differs in several respects from other methods of filling in for missing data , in that with each imputation a different value will be imputed for the missing value , thus ensuring an added dimension of variability in the resulting analyses .
--
score " , a function written for the statistical package SPLUS 6.0 [ 30 ] .
This method used score tests for association between a quantitative trait and the haplotypes .
--
While several other methods could be implemented , this approach was used because of its simplicity in examining existing data .
This method was also chosen because at the onset of analysis , we lacked the more detailed knowledge of the inter-relatedness of our sample often required to perform similar , but more sophisticated approaches within large inbred pedigrees [ 46-48 ] .
--
For the evaluation of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions , we used the MDR method [ 23-26 ] .

The DNA cards method has been used to collect DNA samples in several clinical studies focusing on infective pathogens , such as malaria [ 5 , 10 ] , staphylococcus [ 11 ] , or HIV [ 12 ] , Gaucher disease [ 13 ] and cancer [ 4 , 14 ] .
This method was selected to perform a pharmacogenetic substudy .
--
Mouthwash allows to obtain genomic DNA of high molecular weight from expectorations , an easy way of sample collection for adults but not an option for infants and small children where citobrush are required .
This method has been used in several large epidemiologic studies showing that DNA obtained from buccal cells allows PCR amplification but the yields of DNA are highly variable between specimens and bacterial contamination must be addressed [ 9 ] .
--
Within a clinical trial setting , the DNA-cards method was very well accepted by investigators and patients ( in perception of investigators ) , and was preferred to conventional methods due to its ease of use and safety .
This method is very robust allowing to obtain DNA of quality to perform PCR analyses and obtain the GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotype of all patients of the study .

Genotyping for the single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) at aa19 , aa50 , aa62 , aa133 , and aa219 in SP-A1 and aa9 , aa91 , aa223 in SP-A2 were done using a sequence specific primer-PCR methodology described by Pantelidis et al. [ 25 ] .
This method involves high stringency PCR amplification using allele-specific primers designed with the final 3 ' end nucleotide complementary to the nucleotide variants within a particular SNP locus .
--
Subsequent linkage analyses were also conducted using SOLAR .
This method , described in detail elsewhere [ 37 ] ( see description of the linkage methods in the Overview paper [ 30 ] ) , entails specification of the genetic covariance between arbitrary relatives as a function of the identity-by-descent ( IBD ) relationships at a given marker locus and models the covariance matrix for a pedigree as the sum of the additive genetic covariance attributable to the QTL , the additive genetic covariance due to the effects of loci other than the QTL , and the variance due to unmeasured environmental factors .

This method is not applicable to the detection of point mutations or small sequence changes .
--
A very precise measurement of exon dosage is possible using a second-derivative value of the real-time fluorescence intensity curve .
This method is applicable to the analysis of large patient groups and may become the basis for a diagnostic test .
--
To estimate relative risk ( RR ) of marker ( s ) identified as associated to autism in the present paper , we used a conditional likelihood based method [ 36 ] .
This method estimates haplotype RRs under an additive model from unphased data but also single marker like SNP risk and provides unbiased RR in case of deviation from HWE .
--
Seven mutations were determined by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) based on the method of Wilson et al. [ 17 ] .
This method is as accurate as the dot blot procedure [ 17 ] ; therefore , it is sensitive enough to detect a mutation in only one CYP21A2 gene if more than two copies of the gene are present .

By using the case of an abrupt and sustained reduction in the availability of heroin in Australia in January 2001 , we have shown that problems associated with applying standard ITSA can be overcome by : defining and dating such an event in ways that are not influenced by the outcomes to be modeled ; identifying appropriate indicator series to model ; fitting ITSA models to the data in ways that minimize the effects of researcher bias by using a prescriptive method to select functional depictions of the event and subsequently modifying these using appropriate transfer functions ; and evaluating plausible rival explanations of any changes observed in the time series so that these changes could be more confidently attributed to the unplanned event .
This method is particularly useful for unplanned and poorly understood events ( such as the heroin shortage ) which are of a size and nature that would be difficult or impossible to mimic experimentally , but whose consequences are of potentially great public health interest to researchers and policy makers .

We believe our study is likely to have yielded a higher quality set of predicted binding sites based on the fact that we have access to more recent genome annotations , search in a more tightly focused region ( 1.2 kb versus 10 kb ) , search relative to transcription rather than translation start , and use a prediction algorithm that would screen out some possible spurious predictions likely with a hidden Markov model approach .
This methodological argument that our gene set is closer to the ground truth is supported by the fact that while the two studies predict comparable numbers of CREB sites in mouse and human individually ( 1050 mouse and 1389 human for the present study and 1349 mouse and 1663 human for Conkright et al. ) our predicted sites were validated by cross-species conservation at a rate several-fold higher ( 356 validated versus 78 ) .

It should be noted that the " junior " clinician who used the MINI did not know the formal MINI-generated diagnoses at the time when he or she made his or her own clinical diagnoses .
This method generates four series of diagnoses , corresponding 1. to patients for whom both clinicians independently made the same diagnosis ( strictly speaking , the two clinicians are not independent since the interview is the same. For convenience , we shall nevertheless use this term in the rest of the paper ) , 2. patients for whom at least one clinician made the diagnosis , 3. the consensus diagnoses and 4. the MINI diagnoses .
--
They also used a parallel analysis [ 6 ] where the empirically derived eigenvalues were compared with randomly generated ones .
This method suggested a four-factor solution : ( 1 ) general hypochondriacal fears and beliefs , ( 2 ) symptom experience and frequency of treatment , ( 3 ) thanatophobia , and ( 4 ) fear of coronary heart disease and associated health habits .

The general idea of SET is that subjects learn to regain control over their problems and lives by ( 1 ) determining what really matters to them ( 2 ) investing energy only in those problems that are related to what matters ( 3 ) thinking less negatively about the problems that are unrelated and ( 4 ) accepting those situations that can not be changed .
This method has been found to be effective in several studies in the United States [ 19-21 ] .
--
These items required ratings of the worst harm / pain / illness ever inflicted on oneself , seen or heard about being inflicted upon another , the degree of mother 's and father 's fear , and the most fear ever seen being demonstrated by another person .
This method of eliciting historical and experiential factors in the development of animal fears has been commonly used [ 47 , 48 ] .

The initial method of measuring SPF was by measuring the tritiated thymidine ( 3HTdR ) labelling index ( LI ) [ 7 ] .
This method required the use of fresh material that was incubated with the DNA precursor , usually under high pressure oxygen conditions ( to improve penetration to the tissue fragments ) in an in vitro culture system .
--
The 3HTdR LI tends to be much higher than the mitotic count because cells spend longer in S-phase than M-phase ( approximately 7 to 24 hours as opposed to less than half an hour ) [ 8 ] .
This method allows accurate determination of proliferation rates even if proliferation is very slow , and does not have the problem of difficulty in identifying mitotic cells that is often encountered in mitotic index measurements .

For radiotracer uptake studies , we have since long been working with multicellular aggregates , grown on agar as a method to have easy access to cells .
This method has the additional advantage that it allows easy washing of aggregates followed by a measurement of radiotracer uptake , after which the aggregates can be returned to culture for subsequent evaluations if the radiotracer is a PET tracer with short half-life .

Two single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNP ) , rs4341 and rs4343 , previously found to be in complete linkage disequilibrium with the ACE I / D polymorphism were selected to design polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphisms ( PCR-RFLP ) [ 24 ] .
This method was chosen because previous work in our lab has shown that conventional PCR methods ( including those by Rigat et al. [ 5 ] and Shanmugam et al. [ 25 ] ) and a new deletion-specific PCR amplification test ( developed by Glenn et al. [ 24 ] ) gave inconsistent results in our sample .
--
The decrease of CFR < 2 during follow-up was proposed as a sensitive and specific predictor of restenosis [ 37 , 38 ] .

--
Using 2-D echocardiography the end-systolic ( ESV ) and end-diastolic ( EDV ) volumes were recorded by the method of disc summation based on Simpson 's rule .
This method treats the ventricle as a stack of discs and is recommended because it is independent of preconceived ventricular shape [ 11 ] .

If no frequency shift ( movement ) is detected , no colour is displayed .
This method is ideally suited to high mechanical index destructive imaging , as the first pulse destroys the myocardial micro-bubbles , generating a brief , high amplitude echo rich in harmonics .
--
In a typical configuration , echos from a train of pulses are combined in such a way that signals from moving tissue are eliminated ( see also figure 4 ) .
This method utilises the same signal subtraction principles , as PPI , with the transmitted pulses identical in phase but of different in amplitude or ' power ' - hence power modulation , one impulse of full power , the other half that power .

This may rely to the fact that , in the presence of left bundle branch block , the lateral wall is the latest to be activated , theoretically representing the optimal target for LV lead positioning .
This method has not yet tested in patients without left bundle branch block and its diagnostic accuracy is unknown .
--
Another recent possibility , proposed by Porciani et al , considers the time spent by 12 LV segments in contracting after AVC , i.e. , during the isovolumic relaxation time , and measures the sum of the time of strain tracing exceeding AVC ( ExcT ) on the 12 LV basal and mid-segments ( cut-off value = 760 ms , 93.5 % sensitivity and 82.8 % specificity ) ( Figure 11 ) [ 34 ] .
This method had the advantage to distinguish " contractile systolic asynchrony " , i.e. , temporal dispersion of the regional electromechanical delay within the ejective phase , from " diastolic contractile asynchrony " , which can not be detected by analysing the ejection phase of the cardiac cycle alone .
--
Thus , the expected IMT and diameter values to which the observed values are compared are likely to be free of the effect of major risk factors and so represent ideal values expected for someone of similar age , gender , height , and race .
This method can be used for other arterial sites where disease-free and risk factor-free values are available and could be used to identify diffuse remodeling , absence of remodeling , and constrictive remodeling .

However the interpretation is difficult .
This methodology presents a gross simplification of a complex phenomenon .
But by following this systematic analysis we could get useful diagnostic information and therapeutic options .
This methodology uses pattern recognition with minimal measurements .

--
Currently , the most reliable method for the study of miRNA expression is Northern blot analysis with polyacrylamide gels .
This method can distinguish pre-miRNA and miRNA at the same time , although the technique is relatively insensitive owing to the large total RNA volume needed , and it is labor-intensive .

A more accurate method for assessing the costs of health care services is that of " top-down " costing .
This method is largely used by US. hospitals and involves breaking down department expenditures to obtain procedure-level costs [ 7 ] .
The most prevalent top-down costing approach is the ratio of cost to charge ( RCC ) method .
This method estimates procedure-level costs by computing an overall ratio of departmental aggregate costs to charges and applying this ratio for individual procedures and services .
--
Consequently , the user may choose to use another allocation algorithm such as the reciprocal allocation method .
This method is conceptually appealing because it recognizes the simultaneous interaction of service departments rather than the somewhat arbitrary , one directional relationship the step-down method assumes [ 12 ] .
--
Costs from productivity loss at paid work were calculated according to the friction cost method [ 20 ] .
This method calculates productivity loss costs for the duration of the friction period .
The friction period is the theoretical time needed to fill a vacancy as a result of illness .

We can apply the bootstrap to the model defined by equation ( 1 ) whilst allowing both for the relationship between the cost and the effectiveness and for the non-independence of the cost and the effectiveness due to clustering of the data .
This method has the advantage of not assuming a specific distribution for either the cost or the effectiveness [ 19 ] .
--
The most often encountered approach is the two-limit Tobit technique , which has been adopted as the natural choice for modelling DEA scores in second stage evaluations .
This method is suitable when the dependent variables are censored or corner solution outcomes [ 18 ] , as in the case of DEA scores which are continuous on the [ 0-1 ] interval and take the value 1 with positive probability , while the probability of obtaining the limiting-value 0 is zero .
--
Comparison with no treatment allows the cost effectiveness of this model of CTC to be compared with any other intervention in health , and not just to be considered as an incremental change to alternative nutrition strategies [ 15 , 29 ] .
This method of comparing a health care intervention with the hypothetical alternative of doing nothing , and using probabilistic sensitivity analyses , follows WHO health economists ' recommendations for economic evaluation and priority setting [ 15 , 30 ] .

Thus , in each case , we attempted to achieve a maximal stroke volume , regardless of the amount of fluid required to achieve this goal .
This method takes into account the fact that each patient has his or her own Starling relationship , a well established finding in critically ill patients [ 21 ] , explaining why a definite amount of fluid does not achieve the same hemodynamic effect in each patient .
This is also the rationale for using dynamic indices of preload ; otherwise static measurements of preload would have good predictive value of fluid responsiveness .
This method also ensures that the absence of an increase in CI is not due to insufficient fluid loading .

In order to accomplish expression of the transgene , the aortic root of the donor heart is perfused with adenoviral solution and then heterotopically transplanted into the recipient [ 9 ] .
This method has been used to target robust myocardial overexpression of β2-adrenergic receptors ( β2ARs ) , which translated into a functional effect on the transplanted heart in the form of significantly enhanced basal and agonist-induced contractility [ 10 ] .
Expression of the β2AR transgene was transient , and peak expression was seen at 5 days and returned to baseline levels after 14 days [ 9 ] .

We have implemented a sib-comparison design to examine the effects of migration by using a counter-factual approach of comparing the health outcomes of migrating people with their non-migrating sibs who remain resident in the place of origin of both .
This method overcomes the inherent problems of conventional rural-urban comparisons but makes allowance for temporal life-style and exposure trends that will have affected both migrants and non-migrants , for example , the increased access to energy rich foods throughout India .

Box-Jenkins modeling , also called the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average ( ARIMA ) method , seems promising for complementing infectious disease theories by describing the component structure ( " non explanatory " analysis ) of statistical time series .
This method , widely used in the biological sciences , has rarely been applied to infectious disease modeling , despite the fact that it seems promising for many common infections that show seasonal behaviour and random changes or trends ( non-stationary time series ) .
--
For decades , epidemiology has followed a model in which the goal is to find the infectious agent that is responsible for a disease and break the transmission cycle in populations .
This method has brought us many advances in health , including curbing waterborne disease in post-industrialized countries , the eradication of smallpox , and the identification of HIV .
--
J. Bailey also formed a framework using a chain binomial model , which is useful for household transmission data [ 103,104 ] .
This method estimates the incubation period as the sum of the mean latent period , which follows normal distribution , and a further fixed infectious period ; however , the estimated period does not precisely imply the incubation period , but rather is closer to what is presently referred to as the serial interval [ 48,105 ] .
--
As there was no health information available before the survey , we selected a priori determinants that can influence the spatial homogeneity of the health characteristics .
This method yields a distribution of variables in the sample that closely resembles that in the overall population , something that can not be guaranteed with randomly-selected clusters , especially if the number of selected clusters is small .
--
Spatial clustering not apparent in administrative areas was evaluated using a scan statistic [ 15 ] .
This method involves drawing circles around each ED centroid , of radius increasing from 0 to a pre-set maximum ( in number of births - discussed below ) , and for each circle comparing the observed with the expected number of cases inside the circle .
--
A cluster was considered complete only when data were collected from the minimum number of households and the minimum number of children for that design ( e.g. , 30 × 30 design : minimum 30 households , 30 children per cluster ) .
This method of sampling maintains self-weighted samples for child- and household-level indicators , and permits analysis of mortality data using a standard 30 × 30 household survey [ 2 , 13 ] .
--
Fuel costs were calculated using actual distances ( km ) traveled by design .
This method of analysis was found to be most appropriate but did preclude a cost analysis from being conducted in Habila .

Over the past three decades , field surveys using a cluster sample design have become a standard , popular , and widely used method of measuring key nutrition and health indicators in humanitarian emergencies [ 1-4 ] .
This method was first widely popularized by the Expanded Program on Immunization ( EPI ) of the World Health Organization , which since 1978 has promoted using a 30 cluster design , with 7 children per cluster ( popularly known as " 30 × 7 " ) for measuring immunization coverage [ 5 , 6 ] .
--
Recently published field survey manuals [ 13 , 14 ] advocate calculating sample sizes and determining the number of clusters individually for each planned survey .

--
They showed that under certain assumptions , the missing data mechanism can be ignored and inference can be based solely on the likelihood function of the observed data , which is calculated by integrating out missing values in the likelihood function obtained had data been complete .

The high-volume surface sampler ( HVS3 ) is often used to collect dust samples in the room in which the child had spent the most time .
This method can be expensive and cumbersome , and it has been suggested that an easier method would be to remove dust that had already been collected with the household vacuum cleaner .
--
Early attempts to value mortality risk reductions applied the human capital approach , which estimates the " value of life " as lost productivity .
This method is generally recognized as problematic and not based on modern welfare economics , where preferences for reducing death risks are not captured .
Another limitation is incorporation of racial- or gender-based discrimination in wages .
This method assigns value based solely on income , without regard to social value , so unpaid positions such as homemaker and lower paid positions such as social worker receive lower values .
--
The QALY approach attempts to account for the quality of life lost by adjusting for time " lost " from disease or death .
This method is welfare-theoretic only under very restrictive assumptions , so it is difficult to conceptualize the significance of any particular QALY score .
--
For each subject the follow up periods were 1 year periods ( January - December ) until the year in which they die ( failure ) or until December 1999 ( censoring ) .
This method has been previously described [ 21 ] .
--
To classify the exposure all measured values that were below this limit were replaced previous to the analysis by half of the limit ( 0.025 V / m ) .
This method is often used in context of environmental epidemiology and the results seem plausible , because all values have to be between 0 and the limit of determination [ 34 ] .
--
Scientific peers may judge the methodological rigor of the procedures followed .
This methodological rigor can , for instance , be determined by looking at the theoretical and empirical basis , the reproducibility of the assessment and its acceptance in the peer community .
Furthermore , because the association between exposure and outcome was no longer statistically significant after adjustment for the putative mediators , the authors concluded that " the association between higher education and increased risk of breast cancer appears to be largely explained by differences in the known risk factors for breast cancer " [ [ 8 ] , p. 366 ] .
This methodology is commonly applied , and therefore there are many similar examples in the published literature .

Because incorrect duplications are placed on these branches only when there are genes from three or more descendant branches , pruning the trees so that only two or fewer lineages are represented may allow for more accurate reconstruction of the number of duplicates on these branches .
This method then essentially turns ' non-informative ' branches into ' informative ' branches by reducing the possibility that gene trees are incorrect .

This method is largely being replaced by lipid-based approaches which , although more costly , generally give consistently better transfection efficiencies .
--
In addition , there is potential damage to tissues when used in vivo .
This method is currently best suited to DNA immunization applications .
--
Disadvantages include : significant effort is required to optimize the technique ( duration and strength of pulse ) for each cell type , a relatively high degree of cell death is observed , and transfection efficiency is often low in comparison to other methods .
This method is most applicable to in vitro studies .

The right frontalis , masseter , temporalis , pterygoid , sternocleidomastoid , and trapezius muscles , and the sternocleidomastoid and neck muscle insertions were examined using the TTS system .
This method uses a combination of behavioural and verbal items , each of which is scored on a four-point Likert scale , defined as : 0 denial of tenderness , no visible reaction ; 1 verbal report of discomfort or mild pain , no visible reaction ; 2 verbal report of moderate pain , with or without visible reaction ; 3 verbal report of marked pain and visible expression of discomfort , according to Langermark and Olesen [ 20 ] .
--
Instead we compared two different therapeutic approaches , one with a prevalent effect at the peripheral and the other at the central level .
This method may be limited , because an oral device may produce a placebo effect , which acts at the central level producing an analgesic effect .

In 1971 , Mladick et al. proposed the principle of the retroauricular pocket , for nonmicrosurgical ear reattachment .
This method involved deepithilization of the amputated part , followed by anatomic reattachment to the amputated stump and then burial in a retroauricular pocket [ 7 ] .
--
Moreover , all somatic and visceral nerve fibers were stained using the method of Bodian [ 18 ] .
This method can be used to verify that a stained structure is nervous in nature .
--
The methods used to develop the content of the PBSI combined different procedures that have been used previously in the development of HRQL instruments , including the estimation of impact scores [ 37 ] and the generation of items felt to be impacted upon by stroke survivors [ 52 ] .
This methodology optimized the content validity of the PBSI .
--
Due to the small size of deciles nine and ten , 200 were drawn from the ninth decile and 50 were drawn from the tenth decile for both groups ( see table 5 ) .
This methodology had the effect of providing a sample that was reasonably well distributed between the groups with respect to the characteristics that helped to determine proxy-completed responses .
--
First , the use of the propensity score method may be quite useful in reducing selection bias between self and proxy respondents in survey research .
This methodology provides a unique tool and innovative approach for reducing this bias .
--
Fourth , this study involved linkage of HRQOL survey data with diagnosis codes from administrative medical databases .
This methodology can be used by health care systems and government organizations to examine HRQOL in large samples of individuals with other chronic diseases .
--
In this regard it was necessary to break rank with typical approaches to designing disease- and symptom-specific HRQL instrumentation , since they are based on the premise that measures depend on a careful specification of disease-specific contexts and experiences .
This method of gaining measurement precision was not seen as feasible across disparate and heterogeneous patient populations .
--
In this paper , estimates of αi and βi were obtained using a marginal maximum likelihood based procedure [ 20 ] .
This method assumes that the ability parameters ( θk ) follow a Normal distribution and can account for incomplete designs , as described in the Appendix .
--
The number of latent roots greater than 1 is regarded as an indicator of the number of factors in the data set .
This method is described in more depth in the Appendix .
--
Parents who answered yes or who gave the name of a chronic health condition were coded as having a child with a chronic health condition .
This method has been used in previous work [ 19 , 31 ] , and the PedsQL™ 4.0 scores for the two groups defined using this method ( with and without chronic health condition ) are very similar to those observed in other studies [ 33 ] .
--
The Heckman method was developed by an economist , James Heckman , to address problems of self-selection among women participating in the labor force .
This method makes it possible to assess whether selection bias is present , identify factors contributing to the selection bias , and to control for this bias in estimating the outcomes of interest .
--
For the short form , only relevant items with a factorial weight of > 0.6 were selected .
This method of selection was originally suggested by Grimley [ 21 ] and has successfully been applied elsewhere [ 22 , 23 ]. .
--
For the reasons briefly mentioned in the Introduction , the Item Response Theory [ 8 ] was our primary model for analysis of the questionnaire resulting from the interviews with stoma patients .
This method is built around the idea that the probability of a patient 's answer when confronted with a certain item ideally can be described as a simple function of the patient 's position on a latent trait ( e.g. , quality of life ) plus one or more parameters characterising the particular item ( e.g. , its " severity " or " importance " or " weight " ) .
--
The initial item generation was designed to get the patients to describe all their daily life concerns within the five pre-selected domains .
This method , in our opinion , is preferable compared to item generation based on literature , experts and other second-hand sources .
--
This simultaneously generated patient-reported outcome instrument is one of the few examples of simultaneous development identified in the literature .
This methodology results in a measure with a reduced risk of factors that might otherwise threaten the successful cross-cultural adaptation of the instrument , making the PGCIQ an appropriate instrument for adaptation into multiple languages .
--
The sinergic use of a health status measure ( SF-36 ) and of a tool addressing subjective satisfaction ( SAT-P ) allows to wider the focus on patients ' life .
This methodological approach could help clinicians and researchers in transferring into practice the ICF model issues [ 40 ] , with special attention on Activity and Participation and on Environmental Factors .
--
This technique is increasingly used to analyze the changes over time in QOL data [ 7-10 ] .
This method overcomes some of the limitations of traditional repeated measure techniques and offers additional benefits and information .
--
Obviously , the authors could have chosen a score at which any other proportion of respondents has no difficulty performing a given task , but using a cut-off of 50 % simplifies interpretation because it implies a 1 to 1 chance .
This method of developing interpretation aids could be applied to many other PRO instruments .
--
I also have major concerns about the first method outlined ( 551-554 ) which was not commented on by the FDA .
This method involved mapping changes in PRO scores to clinically relevant and important changes in non-PRO measures and suggests that PRO measures be judged by their similarity to non-PRO measures such as spirometry scores in asthma .
--
The anchor-based approach we used estimates the change score at which the questionnaires discriminate best between improved and stable patients .
This method results in smaller MIC estimates , compared to the other methods , but may be closer to the minimal important change .
--
The ASQOL was translated using the dual-panel approach [ 25 ] .
This method has been uniformly employed in the development of new language versions of needs-based questionnaires including the ASQOL and assumes that the verification and acceptability of translations should rest with people typical of future respondents [ 25 , 26 ] .
--
An econometric scaling method was used for the development of the EuroQol .
This method involved subjects rating health states ( from combining different levels from each item ) and results in values being attached to each health state .
--
The path analysis used structural equation modeling [ 24 ] where all 4 time-points were represented in all models tested .
This method allows the inclusion of feedback or reciprocal paths in addition to unidirectional causal effects [ 25 ] and is therefore more appropriate for our study than standard multiple regression technique .
--
For the analysis of the European study a novel approach was adopted in which items shown to be valued differently in different countries were treated as individual items .
This method of controlling for DIF allowed data from the different countries to be combined in a valid manner .
--
Another limitation of the study is that the list of diagnosis was based on chart review of all diagnoses already made by the primary care physician and no attempt was made to assess whether the diagnoses were correct .
This method has the limitation that conditions frequently misdiagnosed such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , or frequently undiagnosed such as mental disorders were not verified .
One of these methods is a universalist model for the equivalence and adaptation of instruments that relate to health and quality of life [ 19 ] .
This method consists of six steps : conceptual , item , semantic , operational , measurement and functional equivalence .
--
Tracheoesophageal speech significantly improved the quality of life and limited the voice handicap imposed by total laryngectomy .
This method of voice restoration has been used for a number of years in other countries and now appears to be a viable alternative within Jordan .

Qualitative content analysis elicits contextual meaning in context through the development of emerging themes .
This method consisted of identifying , coding and summarizing the concepts and themes , consistent with established qualitative data analysis methods [ 20 ] .
--
Researchers analysed the presence , meanings and relationships between words and concepts , and subsequently made inferences about the messages within the texts .
This method was particularly suitable for productivity , as the outcome of social interactions lends itself to content analysis of the core aspects of social interaction .
Furthermore , this method allowed a closeness to text that can alternate between specific categories and relationships .
This method enabled us to explore rich data and allowed an interpretive understanding of what was going on .
--
However , the significant differences indicated above suggest some variation in need , which might merit additional courses to be developed that would meet the needs of these subgroups .
This methodology could be used to inform and customize CPD provision at a local level , as part of a continuing programme .
--
Consequently , we conduct an alternative specification test described in [ 17 ] .
This methodology tests the joint significance of time-varying variables which have been demeaned and entered directly into the random effects estimation ; joint significance implies that Cov ( Xit , αi ) ≠ 0 and that the random effects estimates are not consistent .
--
As there were few interviews , the researcher decided to take note of the discussions and transcribe near verbatim .

This procedure was applied to the analysis of both a polyA RNA ( Interleukin 10 mRNA ) and non polyA RNAs ( sea urchin 18S and 26S rRNAs ) .
This method might be potentially relevant for the evaluation of the role of posttrascriptional control of IL-10 in the pathogenesis of the immune and inflammatory mediated diseases associated to ageing .
--
We developed a simple , reliable method to map the 3 ' ends of both poly-A and non poly-A RNAs .
This method is reminiscent of S1 mapping [ 1 ] , and makes use of a labelled DNA probe complementary to the 3'-end of the RNA , which contains the presumed 3 ' end of the RNA itself .
--
1000 bootstrap samples were drawn from the predictions in order to estimate the standard error of the Aroc-value , . The best scale was found to be the one by Levitt [ 8 ] ( window size of 11 , Aroc = 0.658 ± 0.013 ) .
This method with will be denoted Levitt .

The adopted empirical scoring function [ 44 , 45 ] takes into account continuum and discrete electrostatics , and hydrophobic and entropy loss [ 45 , 46 ] .
This methodology allows rapid and accurate docking of peptides with an average computing time of approximately 18 minutes for the complete modeling of each peptide on a 4-CPU SGI Origin 3200 workstation .
--
We propose a heuristic-based method ( HBM ) for combining scores from individual prediction tools to make a better prediction .
This method takes advantage of the observation that most of the individual tools make very few false positive predictions when the classification threshold is set sufficiently high , but correspondingly make few predictions of positives .
--
where μ0 and μ1 are the vectors of means for non-epitopes and epitopes , respectively , and ∑ is the average covariance matrix of the scores within the two groups .
This method is optimal ( in the sense of minimizing the probability of misclassification ) if the scores have a multivariate normal distribution with the same covariance matrix for epitopes and non-epitopes .
--
To overcome these limitations , we have developed a structure-based predictive technique that integrates the strength of Monte Carlo simulations and homology modeling [ 13-15 ] .
This method utilizes a probe or " base fragment " to sample different regions of the receptor binding site , followed by loop closure and refinement of the entire class I peptide .
--
These peptides are either single substitution analogs of high affinity binding epitopes or ligands , or large libraries of unrelated peptides .
This method allows detailed probing of the relative role and chemical specificity of each position along the peptide sequence .

--
Key informant methods ask a small ( er ) number of individuals , who are particularly knowledgeable about a network , to identify individuals who serve as main sources of information , influence or both .
This method was used by the other trial .
Self-designating methods [ 7 ] involve self-reporting , by all members of a network , of their own role as an opinion leader .
This method has been used to identify individuals for marketing exercises and for studies promoting individual behaviour change ; however , it has not be used to identify opinion leaders in health care professional groups .
--
A trained evaluator draws inferences from the information to rate the clinician 's behavior on a variety of items that reflect clinical reasoning and competency in the area of interest .
This method was originally developed at McMaster University to evaluate competence in medical practitioners [ 76 ] , and it has been shown to be a valid process in this population [ 75 , 76 , 78 ] , as well as amongst occupational therapists [ 77 ] .
--
The resulting map illustrates a paucity of translational links connecting teams working in research and practice .
This methodology has been used to examine other similar practice networks [ 45 ] .

4. We drew maps of the processes with which we were concerned .
This method for identifying the constituents of conceptual models is called analytical theorizing by Turner [ 37 ] .
--
This enables RF ablation to be delivered by an anatomic approach .
This method is particularly useful in ablation of hemodynamically unstable arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia , because information can be acquired and stored from multiple short runs of tachycardia and ablation then performed in sinus rhythm [ 3 , 10 , 11 ] ) important cardiac structures such as the His bundle , ostia of venous structures , valve annuli and scar tissue can be tagged properly , which are avoided during ablation .
--
By delivering high-frequency ( radiofrequency ) alternating current through ablation catheters , it is possible to create small lesions inside the heart exactly at the anatomical substrate of various arrhythmias .
This method may be curative for patients with atrioventricular reentry ( overt or concealed Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome ) or atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardias .
--
In 1984 , Yee and co-workers described management of what was probably inappropriate sinus tachycardia by subtotal right atrial exclusion in a 27-year-old woman [ 21 ] .
This method entailed the amputation of a large part of the right atrium from all surrounding structures , severing the sinus node artery , and subsequently suturing the excluded portion back .

This method yielded a sensitivity of 51 % and a specificity of 94 % [ 46 ] .
--
Perez-Castellano et al reported a new mapping approach to help localize the atrial insertion of AcP by reproducing the atrial activation sequence during orthodromic tachycardia through atrial pacing at the mapping catheter [ 12 ] .
This method is based on the relative timing of activation between two stable reference electrograms , used to estimate the atrial activation sequence during tachycardia and during pacing ( Figure 2 ) .
--
The highest predictive value of success was reached when the following criteria were fulfilled : difference between activation times shorter than 5 msec , V / A local index lower than 1 , and a stable local electrogram ( EGM ) .
This method is complementary with traditional mapping criteria [ 13 ] and its maximum usefulness is foreseen after non-intentional induction of AcP mechanical block , avoiding procedure discontinuation .
--
The use of transesophageal pacing studies have been shown to have a negative predictive value of 74-100 % for predicting SVT recurrences [ 17 , 18 ] .

--
The probe was refrigerated to -60°C and its effectiveness was evaluated during continuous monitoring of the cardiac electrical activity .
This method , largely used in the past [ 2-4 ] for antiarrhythmic surgery and still in use for the treatment of some forms of ventricular tachycardia [ 5 , 6 ] , is safe and effective .
--
Measurement of these variables when studied along with other risk factors has shown superior risk prediction for sudden cardiac death .

Both linear and non-linear methods of assessment of QT dynamics have been described .
This method computes linear regressions between QT and RR intervals and measures the regression slope .
--
One approach to the evaluation of this natural behaviour of QT dynamics is to evaluate it over several minutes of stable narrow ranges of heart rate .
This method , however , causes loss of information regarding QT dynamics over different ranges of heart rate .
--
The QTcj ranges between 384 and 448 ms .
This method is highly reproducible in healthy subjects and detects small intra-individual changes .
--
Lown’s rationale for this approach was to minimise post-shock arrhythmia [ 18 ] .

Therefore , intracardiac maps are obtained with intracardiac catheters with integrated magnetic sensors ( e.g. CARTO™ ) , which allows recording of endocardial signals as well as the corresponding anatomical location of the catheter tip .
This method allows electroanatomic imaging of activation time maps with sufficient spatiotemporal resolution using color-coded plots .
--
The result of RF ablation at the site of the shortest interval has remained inconsistent as seen in various studies and varies from 0 to 100 % [ 10 , 17-20 ] .
This method is time and labour intensive and very inaccurate because it is difficult to stimulate from many sites at the same distance from the annulus .

A 50 metre buffer was chosen to ensure that parcels along the selected roads would be included but that most parcels located further from the road ( e.g. behind those adjacent to the road ) would not be selected .
This method is based on the idea that land use encountered along roads is most important in characterizing a neighbourhood in the way it is experienced by residents walking through it , and land not accessible to the pedestrian , even if physically nearby , is not part of their 1 km walking neighbourhood .
--
Previous methods to construct a network-based local neighbourhood have used journey endpoints ( e.g. 1 km along the road network ) as vertices from which to build a polygon delineating the neighbourhood .
This method presents a vast improvement over the simple circular buffer method because it takes into account that the area of a " local neighbourhood " is necessarily restricted by the manner in which one is able to traverse the landscape - a pedestrian can not travel " as the crow flies " but is instead forced to travel along existing roadways .
However , the methodology currently presented even further improves the definition of a local neighbourhood by constraining the shape to more closely follow roads and thus exclude large inaccessible areas between diverging roads ( see Figures 1 & 2 ) .
This method may better represent the local neighbourhood of an individual as it would be experienced by that person as they walked through it .
--
This study has shown how a fairly simple model of the distribution of registered patients around a general practice can be used to predict a practice population-weighted area-based measure of socioeconomic deprivation .
This method appeared superior to the common practice of linking the practice postcode alone to the deprivation score assigned to the area in which the practice is located .
--
Our model may also avoid a systematic underestimation of IMD score in less deprived areas , and a systematic overestimation of scores in more deprived areas , that was seen when using postcode-linked scores .
This method may therefore be of use to researchers who do not have access to patient level spatially referenced data .

Cross-correlation with the seasonality and autocorrelation removed by simple pre-whitening allows for detection of the time lag ( s ) of rainfall preceding malaria , at which divergences from the long term seasonal pattern in rainfall time series show strongest correlation with such divergences in detrended malaria case count time series , while minimizing effects of spurious correlations caused by autocorrelation in the time series .
This method bears some similarity to anomaly analysis , where the cross-correlation of aberrations from the long term seasonal mean of the explanatory variables is correlated with aberrations from the long term seasonal mean of the response variable .

--
The PCR protocol of Tassanakajon et al [ 10 ] was optimized using Plasmodium genomic DNA as template .
This method is designed to detect only P. falciparum and the sensitivity using dilutions of P. falciparum DNA showed the limit of detection to be a 1 in 10,000 dilution ( Figure 1 ) representing a low limit detection of 2 picograms of DNA .
--
It is likely these additional positive samples are false positives as the trial using artificially infected mosquitoes indicated a lower sensitivity of detection than the nested approach .
This method scored no samples positive when using DNA derived from mosquitoes stored in ethanol indicating that this storage method may not be suitable for this assay .

Quantitation of this reference DNA sample was linear over a large quantitation range and was generally comparable to both standard pico green and spectrophotometric methods .
This method has the advantage of being able to quantify P. falciparum DNA within a patient sample that contains human DNA .

In conclusion , TaqMan technology is a methodology that allows rapid , reliable , and inexpensive genotyping of alleles across the P. falciparum genome , and may be applied to genotyping genetic loci that are important for drug resistance , invasion , virulence , and immunity .
This methodology has been applied to develop a molecular bar code that provides a unique signature for the purposes of tracking parasites in the laboratory and within patient samples .
This method provides a uniform and reliable method to genotype the identity of parasites when compared to conventional MSP-1 and MSP-2 genotyping , is able to identify mixtures of alleles in a sample that would otherwise be classified as containing a single parasite genome .

The amount of TTX present in dorsal skin of individual newts was quantified with high-performance liquid chromatography-fluorescence detection , and estimates of total skin TTX ( in mg ) per animal were generated following previously published methods [ 28 , 49 , 50 , 53 , 55 ] .
This methodology has been shown to be a highly repeatable and accurate method for measuring dorsal skin TTX levels [ 28 , 49 , 53 , 55 ] as well as for estimating the total skin TTX of individual animals [ 49 ] .
To better isolate activity related to the control of attention shifts , researchers have begun to compare activity associated with the presentation of attend cues to activity associated with the presentation of neutral cues that either provide no information about the location of the impending target ( i.e. , noninformative cues ) [ 6 ] or signify that the target will not occur ( i.e. , interpret cues ) [ 4 , 14 , 28 ] .
This method controls for the presentation of the sensory cue stimuli and also permits the detection of both spatially specific and spatially nonspecific neural responses .

This method identified 19 unannotated genes , which were then confirmed with RT-PCR and sequencing of cDNA from whole males .
--
To quantify these results , we initially applied the Fisher z transformation to all correlation coefficients .
This method transforms the non-normally distributed correlation coefficients into normally distributed variables , which allows the use of standard analysis of variance methods [ 19 ] ( for details , see Materials and Methods ) .
--
One way to characterize neural circuits is to extract statistical properties of connectivity , often by pooling data from multiple animals [ 3-6 ] .
This method assumes that connectional specificity at the level of classes of cells suffices to account for the properties of circuits [ 7-9 ] .
--
In the gene circuit method , ( 1 ) a gene circuit model , in which one real number characterizes the regulatory effect of one gene on another , is ( 2 ) fit to quantitative gene expression data by ( 3 ) parallel Lam simulated annealing [ 28 , 29 ] or some other nonlinear optimization method [ 30-32 ] , and finally ( 4 ) biological conclusions are obtained .

The CLR test [ 38 ] uses the spatial distribution of mutation frequencies in a genomic region and levels of variability among a population sample of DNA sequences to test for evidence of a selective sweep .
This method compares the ratio of the composite likelihood of the data under the standard neutral model of constant population size , neutral evolution , and random mating , LN ( Data ) to the composite likelihood of the data under the model of a selective sweep , LS ( α̂ , X̂|Data ) , where α is the maximum likelihood estimate ( MLE ) of 2Ns , and X is the MLE of the location of the beneficial mutation .
--
This approach is not model independent , however , as coalescent simulations under the standard neutral model , using the exact configuration of the empirical dataset ( with each locus having a unique θ and L ) , are necessary to determine the significance of the test statistic .
This method takes polymorphism data and creates a grid of locations over the given region , and compares the maximum composite likelihood ratio of the hypothesis of a sweep with the null hypothesis of no sweep for each location .

One such strategy is to join forces and form biofilms , communities of microbial cells and their sticky secreted extracellular matrix that can adhere to a variety of surfaces .
This method is used by Candida albicans , a fungal pathogen that can cause irritating ailments like yeast infections and thrush , as well as life-threatening diseases in immunocompromised people .

--
A crossover design was used , with each participant receiving each supplement and a placebo in sequence .
This method enabled a smaller number of participants to be used to answer the question of interest , as compared to parallel-group designs .
--
We used msp2 genotyping in a subset of parasitological treatment failures to estimate the recrudescence rate in each treatment group .
This method is prone to underestimate the true number of recrudescent infections in areas of stable transmission , because the PCR method will not pick up minority genotypes that may be present in the pretreatment sample at low abundance .
--
Strengths and limitations : In this trial , health-care providers were randomized , rather than patients .
This method ( cluster randomization ) is probably the most appropriate method to carry out a trial such as this , because it reduces the chance of contamination ( i.e. , that patients not assigned to the intervention might receive some of its benefits ) .
--
If the patient consented , the telephonic baseline interview was started .
This method of recruitment , unaffected by the PCPs ' diagnostic or therapeutic behaviour , ensured that the recruited patients included in the intervention and control groups were comparable , and at least not subjected to selection bias .
--
We model the extraction problem as a combinatorial detection problem for at least three specific reasons : ( 1 ) The data are obtained from a replica exchange molecular dynamics ( REMD ) method [ 24 ] ( more details below ) .
This method is essentially a Monte Carlo method ; thus , the time series is not strictly real time due to the random Monte Carlo exchange process .
--
If a cluster did not contain a protein with an experimentally derived GO annotation , no functions were transferred ; if a protein was present in multiple clusters , it would receive annotations transferred within each of those clusters .
This method yields an unranked set of predictions for each protein .
--
Thus , the model and the method , besides being consistent with a requirement of a high percentage of inhibition for an ideal drug , also show their utility in analysing drug action when any quantitative data become available .
This method also has the potential to consider inhibition at multiple points .
--
Our approach applies an expectation-maximization algorithm to a model derived from a novel classification of SNP array probes .
This method is the first to our knowledge that is able to ( a ) determine the generalized genotype of aberrant samples at each SNP site ( e.g. , CCCCT at an amplified site ) , and ( b ) infer the copy number of each parental chromosome across the genome .
--
Using the complete predicted protein sets of each organism , we ran reciprocal BLASTP analyses to identify putative orthologs between E. histolytica and D. discodeum , using only proteins that hit a cognate with an e-value of ≤ 10−5 , and requiring that each protein return its cognate from the other genome as a best hit when used as a query .
This method , referred to as reciprocal best hits ( RBHs ) , was adapted from the construction of the Clusters of Orthologous Genes ( COG ) database at the National Center for Biotechnology Information ( NCBI ) [ 9 ] .
--
In order to detect such long-range periodic patterns in inherently noisy chromosome position-dependent data , wavelet analysis has been used in several studies [ 13 , 15 ] ( Figure 1 ) .
This method has previously been used to detect patterns in gene orientation [ 14 ] , DNA-bending profiles [ 16 ] , and gene expression data [ 17 , 18 ] in prokaryotes , as well as GC / AT skew oscillations in human chromosomes [ 19 ] .
--
Lunter et al. introduce a method that exploits the evolutionary imprint of sequence insertions and deletions ( so-called indels ) to pinpoint functional DNA regions that have been subject to purifying selection .
This method hinges on a simple theoretical prediction for the distribution of indels across the human genome .
--
A new method has been introduced recently [ 16 ] that might approach natural biocombinatorics principles much more than any earlier trial .
This method allows for an adaptation of the codon usage to a suitable expression host like Escherichia coli and the introduction of unique restriction sites flanking domains , linkers , and modules .
--
In this work , we have designed and implemented a protocol that augments the results from Rosetta ab initio modeling by using cryoEM density as a means for assessment .
This methodology ( described in detail in Materials and Methods ) leverages the medium-resolution density envelope supplied by the cryoEM density map to provide the overall shape and density distribution in evaluating models when no structural homolog is known .
--
Conversely , lack of improvement indicates that the new feature is redundant with previously known features .
This method should be quite useful in evaluating the influence of newly annotated genomic features on integration .
--
For seven subjects the first peak was followed by a prominent second peak ; two of these subjects had a secondary isolated peak ( near k = 0.75 sec−1 ) , and for five of these subjects , a higher frequency component appeared at k = 1 sec−1 ( e.g. , subject 3 ) .
This method confirmed the results of the generalized hyperbolic model fit , as 13 subjects were identified as pure exponential discounters by both methods .
--
In this paper , we have used our evolutionary design method to design cis-regulatory domains of single operons .
This method , however , could also be applied to design larger networks , such as multi-input modules [ 52 ] .
--
The authors introduce a framework that uses a technique called kernel density estimation to find the regions in the genome that show a significant increase in insertion density .
This method is implemented over a range of scales , allowing the data to be evaluated at any relevant scale .
--
To calculate p-values we repeated the shuffling 1,000 times and computed the probability to achieve a score equal or higher than the score of the original ( nonshuffled ) data .
This methodology was chosen since , in contrast to the prediction assay , the scores obtained by the shuffling procedure were not normally distributed .
--
Recently , a new method for identifying fibril-forming segments of proteins has been suggested [ 21 ] .
This method is based on the threading of six-residue peptides through the known crystal structure of an amyloid fiber [ 15 ] formed by the peptide from Sup35 .
--
To account for multiple testing problems , we employ the method of FDR as a multiple comparison procedure [ 23 ] .
This method is less conservative compared to the classic Bonferroni correction , which make it more applicable for testing large numbers of relatively short time series produced by microarray experiments .
--
These differences can be assumed to represent directional mutations from the consensus sequence state to the extant sequence state ( Figure S2A ) .
This method is akin to the “substitution rate” method described by Green et al. but is applied to the content of interspersed repeats .
--
Artificial networks can be constructed following the suggestions derived from mathematical modeling and then characterized by combining theoretical and experimental studies [ 12 ] .
This methodology has already been successfully applied in the case of oscillatory genetic networks .
--
The entire conformational space of the loop is sampled with varying sampling resolution in a hierarchical manner .
This method has proven successful in recreating crystallographic conformations of unphosphorylated loops to loop lengths of 12 residues .
--
In order to capture these essential structural rearrangements in the region surrounding the loop , we also optimize the conformations of all side chains that have at least one atom within 4.5 Å of the loop , as described in Materials and Methods .
This method permits all cases , excepting extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 ( ERK2 ) , to be predicted with near-atomic accuracy , especially the phosphate group itself .

This method has been used to screen the regions of the human genome that are under strong selective constraints .
--
LOH is resolved to about 3 Mb or 100 SNPs in 100 K array data .
This method makes it feasible to use SNP array technology to map LOH in tumor samples for which normal DNA is unavailable .
--
We used a haplotype correction that compared regions of inferred putative LOH to a set of reference normal samples to reduced false LOH inference .
This method works best if the reference samples have similar haplotypes to the tumor sample .
--
One can then compile the statistics of the knots formed by many random loop closures after generating several pairs of points .
This method is similar to that used in [ 1 , 12 , 13 ] .
--
The figurative representation of SPLs ( e.g. , Figure 1 ) is also a visualization of the inner structures of a regulatory network which could be used to obtain a clearer picture of network activity .
This method for network subgraph analysis might also be applied to other biological or non-biological networks , such as metabolic networks , neuronal circuits , or electronic chips .
--
This presumption is based on the power law nature of TRNs [ 17 , 18 ] , which implies that more highly connected TFs are more likely to be involved in undiscovered regulatory interactions .
This methodology has the added advantage of ( dis ) confirming rules already in the model , but this becomes less of an issue as subsequent iterations utilize more speculative information in place of rules in the model as a basis for suggesting experiment designs .
--
One long-standing implementation of this model , Mfold [ 11 ] , quantifies the degree of hybridization and the stability of RNA secondary structure by calculating the change in energy ( ΔG ° ) [ 12-14 ] .
This method for estimating free energy has been adapted to identify SD sequences by repeatedly calculating the ΔG ° values for progressive alignments of the rRNA tail with the mRNA in the region upstream of the start codon [ 5 , 6 , 15 , 16 ] .
--
On the other hand , reactions with ΔG ° values less than zero are likely to take place .
This method has been used in many studies of SD sequences [ 6 , 9 , 15 , 16 , 47-49 ] , as well as in the genome annotation program GLIMMER [ 29 ] .
--
Briefly , this procedure involved two steps : ( 1 ) random disruption of genes by transposon mutagenesis to generate growth mutants , and ( 2 ) competitive hybridization between insertion and gene probes to identify mutants that could not survive in nutrient-rich media .
This method predicted 614 genes essential for growth in vitro , but with a predicted 1 % false discovery rate [ 8 ] .
--
Coupled with additional biological knowledge , however , the results of EMBP analysis can help infer disease-related pathways , which , in turn can help develop therapeutic interventions .
This methodology uses the clues provided by the results to create speculative assumptions involving additional genes .
--
For this purpose , we applied an algorithm that identified all TF combinations regulating common targets and assigned p-values of significance to these overlaps [ 26 ] .
This method of module identification is scalable to much larger datasets , which will be particularly necessary in view of the complex transcriptional regulation observed in higher eukaryotes [ 8 ] .
--
Parametric alignment is one possible remedy .
This methodology resolves the issue of robustness to changes in parameters by finding all optimal alignments for all possible parameters in a PHMM .
--
We introduce a method for determining the active reactions in a genome-scale metabolic network based on a limited number of experimentally measured fluxes .
This method , called optimal metabolic network identification ( OMNI ) , allows efficient identification of the set of reactions that results in the best agreement between in silico predicted and experimentally measured flux distributions .
--
Another method that can be viewed as an approximation to full Bayesian analysis is Discriminant Analysis invented by Sir Ronald A. Fisher [ 9 ] .
This method requires no assumption about conditional independence of features ; instead , it assumes that the conditional probability P ( F = Fi | C = ck ) is a multivariate normal distribution .
--
The second study we use for comparison describes a fragment assembly method that uses secondary structure information derived from the true structure to produce compact decoys [ 13 ] .
This method does not make use of sequence information , but only secondary structure information .
--
The x-axis depicts the nt site within the alignment .
This method , and related methods ( e.g. , GENECONV ) , scan aligned sequences and determine recombination breakpoints based on shared polymorphic sites among sequence pairs .
--
Accurate oculomotor tracking can be prevented by inducing or simulating changes in the oculomotor plant , so that plant compensation is tested directly .
This method seems rarely to have been used .
--
One of the more successful electronic methods for detecting functionally associated genes has been through the comparison of genes ' phylogenetic profiles .
This method is based on the hypothesis that two functionally related genes will show very similar presence-absence profile patterns throughout different organisms .
--
We have developed a novel modification of the phylogenetic profile method that bypasses several of these problems , especially the orthology—or functional equivalence as it can also be perceived—detection problem , and can detect interacting multigene families .
This method is particularly applicable to identifying functional networks in eukaryotes , which have so far proven intractable .
--
Another approach is to search only transcribed sequences in the form of expressed sequence tags [ 7 , 8 ] .
This method works for nonsequenced genomes and efficiently reduces the search space , probably leading to a lower number of false positives , but the method also misses candidates not covered by the expressed sequence tag libraries .
--
Another approach , which is robust to HWE assumptions , is to estimate the HET rate ( and its variance ) directly by population allele frequencies [ 16 ] .
This method requires large sample sizes in order to achieve accurate estimation of HET rates .
--
With this method , samples are tested one by one and a decision will be made to determine whether or not the HET rate of a SNP has reached a prespecified value after each sample is tested .
This method generally requires less time and reagents and conserves biospecimens that are frequently unique and difficult to obtain .
--
, allowing the decomposition into a periodic part and an unbounded part as described previously .
This method , in contrast to some previous publications [ 27 , 46 ] , enables the exact computation of the period sensitivities rather than approximating the result by truncation of a limit or by integration of the entire system for a sufficiently long time , resulting in significantly less computational effort and , in principle , exact results .
--
Mutation Miner approaches the problem differently .
This method identifies and relates proteins , organisms , and point mutations using NLP analysis at a sentence level .
An entity pair is assigned if both entities match noun phrase patterns .
This method would work well if all point mutations were described in conjunction with associated proteins and organisms at the sentence level , which we have observed is not always the case .
--
Our graph bigram method improves on this approach by accounting for all occurrences of the point mutation and protein terms throughout the length of the text instead of measuring one local relationship .
This method uses the t test to measure the significance of bigrams in the text , then employs a graph shortest-distance search to traverse significant bigrams to associate a point mutation with its correct protein term .
--
It gives more reliability to the interaction of two families that contain a greater number of interactions between paralogous proteins .
This method identified ∼40 % true interactions at a 1 % error rate .
--
In contrast to what the authors claim , maximum likelihood methods , although less vulnerable , are similarly affected by LBA [ 5 ] , particularly when small numbers of taxa are used [ 6 ] .
This methodological bias has led to various erroneous inferences , such as the now-discredited claim that “the guinea pig is not a rodent” [ 7 , 8 ] .
--
The best classification results were obtained using a Bayesian network classifier ( see Materials and Methods ) .
This method assigned a probability for every site in the genome .
--
Our study provides a robust statistical framework for detection and computational validation of dual-coding regions .
This methodology will work equally well in genome-wide screens ( this study ) and in situations in which an ARF in a single gene needs to be evaluated .
--
The phase tmax that produces the highest correlation is considered the most likely phase for the gene x .
This method is superior to the assignment of phase based on the position of peaks because it takes into account all data points in the series .
--
We simulate these events along each actin strand of the thin filament in conjunction with Tmspam ( introduced above in the geometry section ) .
This method directly links spatial and kinetic characteristics of troponin and tropomyosin to regulate actomyosin binding , which is unique to this model .
--
GSA of two successive Stat3 activation profiles was used to understand what pathway components control desensitization .
This method distinguishes between desensitization and inhibition , since both successive activation profiles will be changed by inhibition , but only the reactivation profile is influenced by desensitization .
--
We present neighbor clustering , a new computational method for further analyzing bacterial microarray data that combines two informative characteristics of bacterial genes that share common function or regulation : ( 1 ) similar gene expression profiles ( i.e. , co-expression ) ; and ( 2 ) physical proximity of genes on the chromosome .
This method identifies statistically significant clusters of co-expressed gene neighbors that potentially share common function or regulation by coupling statistically analyzed gene expression profiles with the chromosomal position of genes .
--
Thus , if clusters containing a particular gene were of equal significance , we report the cluster with the most gene members .
This method identified 47 significant clusters containing 173 differentially expressed genes ( listed in Table 3 and visualized in Figures 2 and S2-S4 ) , a considerably larger group than could have been compiled using only the initial 79 significant genes .
--
A matrix of the number of times that each TE has transposed into every other TE was constructed , and a novel objective function was developed that derived the chronological order and relative ages of human TEs spanning > 100 million years .
This method has been used to infer the relative ages across all four major TE classes , including the oldest , most diverged elements .
--
We performed a genome-wide defragmention of TEs , and developed a novel objective function to derive the chronological order of TEs spanning > 100 million years .
This method has been used to infer the relative ages of TEs from seven sequenced mammalian genomes across all four major TE classes , including the oldest , most diverged elements .
--
A novel computational method was developed that uses the age information implicit in the patterns of TE insertions to determine the relative chronological age of TEs in the human and other genomes spanning over 100 million years , independent of sequence divergence and the molecular clock .
This method confirms the relative ages of TEs within classes , and was used to determine the relative ages of TEs between different classes and for older elements for which sequence divergence is particularly unreliable .
--
Hence , the relative ages are determined across different classes and subfamilies of TEs .
This method is as applicable to the older elements as it is to the younger elements .
--
Otherwise , meaningful results have been obtained by studying distribution patterns in flattened 2D cell nuclei [ 11 , 12 ] .
This method can not be used to calculate absolute distances because of the disruptive effects of the cell preparation method on cell nucleus topology , but is generally considered sufficient for statistical analysis of relative distance measurements .
--
It is also possible to quantify relative spatial proximity in terms of orbital arrangement using the angle formed between compartments and the nuclear centre .
This method was originally used to study the positions of chromosomes on prometaphase chromosome rosettes [ 19 , 36 ] and has been used more recently in interphase cells [ 20 ] , where the wide range of angles measured between homologous chromosomes argued against the existence of a highly ordered orbital arrangement of chromosomes .
--
An alternative method is to use distance-based approaches , where distances are those measured between the centroids ( or the intensity gravity centres ) of the nuclear compartments of interest .
This method is probably most applicable to those compartments having simple focal distribution patterns and has been particularly useful in quantitating the degree of physical proximity between genomic loci involved in imprinting [ 49 ] , radiation-induced chromosomal rearrangements [ 50 ] , and chromosome translocations [ 51 , 52 ] .
--
To answer such need , we introduce here an imaging methodology that can predict DSB location for any given DNA nuclear pattern from real images .
This methodology is based on the same Monte Carlo concepts described in Materials and Methods for the generation of DSBs in artificial nuclei : i.e. , the probability of a DSB at a given location is proportional to the DNA density at the same location .
--
Samba produced 23 biclusters from the synthetic data ( unpublished data ) .
This method tended to find small subsets of genes co-expressed in some tissues , but did not recover the four gene sets as coherent biclusters .
--
Previous approaches for summarizing Dirichlet Process mixture model components have used pairwise co-clustering probabilities as a similarity measure for input into an agglomerative clustering algorithm [ 14 ] .
This method is feasible if there are a relatively small number of items to be clustered , and we employ it for producing consensus tissue groups .
--
In addition to classification of novel sequences to predefined subfamilies , we present a method of logistic regression of positive and negative examples for subfamilies .
This method enables discrimination between novel sequences that can be reliably classified to an existing subfamily and those that are more likely to represent entirely different subtypes from any previously observed .
--
Any bases inserted in a monomer but not present in the consensus ( thus a specific insertion for that monomer ) would induce gaps to the other monomer when pairwise alignments are performed .
This method of normalizing the sequences precipitates the removal of such bases inserted in a monomer that would not be counted in any case , while aligning the conserved regions ( along with substituted bases ) to the same coordinates .
--
To synthesize these approaches , we explore sensitivity landscapes , which provide a global picture of parameter sensitivities while identifying how intrinsic properties of individual neurons influence their firing patterns .
This method can be adapted easily to compare sensitivities of parameters in any computational model .
--
In contrast , the mosaic method that we recently described [ 2 ] assembles a specified number of full-length protein sequences that in combination optimize coverage of epitope length peptides in a population .
This method creates intact HIV proteins that have the potential for natural expression and processing of epitopes .

To aid in the discovery of functional elements outside of these well-annotated loci , we develop an unbiased method that searches for commonly occurring histone modification patterns on a global scale without using any annotation information .
This method recovers known patterns associated with transcriptional enhancers and promoters .
--
We selected 12 species among the fungi phylum tree as representatives , and used our method of event detection on the corresponding proteomes .
This method only identified events which occurred inside protein coding genes , but , given the evolutionary distances between species , trying to detect events in intergenic regions would have certainly have been worthless .
--
Here , we describe a method for the detection of rate-shifting sites in a protein across all lineages in the phylogeny .
This method , hereby termed RASER ( RAte Shift EstimatoR ) is based on the likelihood framework , combined with empirical Bayesian inference .
--
We construct several datasets , by a unique method depending on two parameters , max-gap and min-len .
This method , or very similar ones , are often used to construct synteny blocks from genomic alignments [ 40 ] , [ 41 ] , [ 59 ] .
--
The contours chosen in this manner agree well with methods that require calibration of the images against a membrane dye [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , and have the added advantage that they do not require system-specific calibration .
This method for choosing the intensity threshold at which to draw the contour has the additional advantages of not relying on any global parameters of the image and of being insensitive to the contrast between the cell and the background .
--
Here we present a novel method for comparing and merging motifs , based on Bayesian probabilistic principles .
This method takes into account both the similarity in positional nucleotide distributions of the two motifs and their dissimilarity to the background distribution .

In the final step the obtained structure is optimized through the employment of a force field [ 27 ] , [ 28 ] .
This method works well for small all α class proteins , and reasonably well for α / β , α+β and all β class proteins .
--
We included the domain architecture comparison strategy that exhibited the best performance from that study in our current study .
This method assigns a score to each pair based on the number of shared domains ( see Methods ) , following the rationale that homologous pairs will have more domains in common than pairs related through domain insertion .
--
The statistical significance of the difference between the ROC-n scores obtained by Neighborhood Correlation and sequence similarity was estimated using p-values calculated using the method described in Schaffer et al. [ 62 ] .
This method tests the null hypothesis that the difference in ROC-n scores is due the sampling process used to obtain the test data .
--
Recently , a method called Biological Objective Solution Search ( BOSS ) was developed for the inference of an objective function for a biological system from its underlying network stoichiometry as well as experimentally-measured flux distributions [ 54 ] .
This method identifies objectives from experimental fluxes by defining a putative stoichiometric objective reaction , adding this reaction to the existing set of stoichiometric constraints , and maximizing it via linear programming .
--
In glycome informatics , the layered-trimer kernel was first developed and used to verify the utility of using kernels for glycan biomarker prediction [ 26 ] .

Using this kernel on the leukemia dataset described above , the model was able to extract a feature that was highly characteristic of leukemia , which was corroborated by experimental evidence .
This method extended the layered-trimer kernel in order to account for potential glycan biomarkers that were smaller or larger than trimers , without the use of layers , since it was assumed that layer information could be subsumed by the wider distribution of features .
--
Once this co-occurrence score matrix was developed , it could be used to make predictions from expression data .
This method was further improved such that ( i ) the database of glycans were augmented with new glycans that should exist and ( ii ) the prediction score for glycans used the expression values directly as opposed to using binary values .

This method has been extended in several ways [ 5 ] - [ 8 ] .
--
For this purpose , we developed a new method to compute substitution rates for individual nucleotides , taking into account the hypermutability of CpG dinucleotides and the non-stationarity of base composition .
This method is based on a maximum-likelihood ( ML ) approach , and hence is more reliable than the parsimony approach used previously .
--
In this system , which we named iKO , the target gene can be turned on and off at will by treating the mice with doxycycline .
This method combines two genetically modified mouse lines : a ) a KO line with a tetracycline-dependent transactivator replacing the endogenous target gene , and b ) a line with a tetracycline-inducible cDNA of the target gene inserted into a tightly regulated ( TIGRE ) genomic locus , which provides for low basal expression and high inducibility .
--
The functional enrichment analysis introduced here allows association between eQTLs and biological pathways , enabling the identification of both novel members and novel regulators of these pathways .
This method may be particularly relevant and complementary to whole-genome association studies in large clinical populations [ 29 ] - [ 34 ] .
--
Previously , we examined the microbial selenoproteome of the Sargasso Sea via searches for Sec / cysteine ( Cys ) pairs in homologous sequences [ 25 ] .
This method performed well and further research has shown that it is reliable in identifying selenoproteins in both organism-specific and environmental genomes [ 24 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 31 ] .
--
First , association analysis was done with correction by genomic control .
This method estimates the average effect of population substructure in the sample ( based on median T values ) and accordingly corrects the test statistics [ 18 ] .
--
For a linked locus , the genomic DNA in one pool will be enriched for one parental inheritance , and therefore will show a peak of inheritance when comparing the array results across the pooled progeny of the phenotype ( Figures 5A and B ) .
This method allowed us to screen a large number of segregants and measure the average genotype of progeny within each pool .
--
As we have shown here , applying this algorithm significantly increases genotyping savings , reducing the number of SNPs needed for structure identification almost by six-fold .
This method for redundancy removal can be applied to any set of SNPs in order to select a minimally correlated subset .
--
The most commonly used approach for pathway analysis , the enrichment or overrepresentation analysis , uses Fisher 's exact test .
This method starts with a list of differentially expressed genes based on an arbitrary cutoff of nominal p-values , and compares the number of significant genes in the pathway to the rest of the genes to determine if any gene-set is overrepresented in the significant gene list .
--
Our results offer strong proof that the Solexa method can be used to rapidly reveal multiple aspects of genomic content and organization , especially base substitutions , which greatly simplifies experimental design and facilitates our understanding of the biology of model organisms .
This method can be applied broadly , including to similar studies with other bacterial and higher organisms [ 12 ] .
--
The second component is used to test the SNPs for association , where information from the screening is used to weight the SNPs during testing .
This methodology is more powerful than standard procedures for multiple comparisons adjustment ( i.e. , Bonferroni correction ) .
--
In summary , we propose that our estimator of recurrent hitchhiking model parameters that incorporates information from multiple summary statistics performs reasonably well .
This method is preferable to a π-based approach both because it is more accurate and more robust to variation in mutation rate .
--
A , B ) Formation of COs and NCOs were assayed by the approach of Storlazzi et al. [ 98 ] .
This method monitors the appearance of two species which , in WT meiosis , are known from tetrad analysis to arise specifically in association with CO and NCO recombination ( “COs” and “NCOs” ; Panel A , top ) .
--
We also employ a separate method for estimating the breeding sex ratio in each population that does not allow for intra-locus recombination but does permit independent mutation rates across loci ( see Methods ) .
This method produces similar results to those described above , with estimates of the ratio of female to male effective population size ranging from 1.8 in the San to 14.0 in the Basque ( Table S3 ) .
--
We therefore made an analysis in 5 kbp sliding windows along the multiple genome alignment to identify the most phylogenetically incongruent regions ( see Material and Methods ) .
This method identified two large regions of very strong incongruence , one centred around rfb ( Figure S8 ) , the operon involved in O antigen synthesis , and the other around the leuX tRNA gene , and including fimA , which is under diversifying selection and is involved in the adhesion of bacteria to host cells [ 66 ] .
--
The Harrington and Fleming procedure was used to assess differences among Kaplan-Meier survival curve .
This method was also implemented in the survdiff function of the R survival package .
--
A recently developed branch support measure , the approximate Likelihood Ratio Test ( aLRT ) , can also be used to assess the support for branches [ 30 ] .
This method compares the likelihood of a tree with the branch of interest collapsed to alternate model in which the branch has the length inferred from the data and tests whether there is sufficient data for the inferred branch to be “real” .
--
We note that a region that contains a large number of moderately relevant SNPs can also achieve a high regulatory potential .
This method of aggregation tends to prefer regions with more SNPs , which is arguably justified , as they are also more likely to contain a causal polymorphism .
--
To control for the possibility of spurious associations resulting from population stratification we used the EIGENSTRAT approach of Price et al [ 57 ] .
This method derives the principal components of the correlations among gene variants and corrects for those correlations in the association tests .
--
If a pathway contains G non-overlapping genes , a method to do this is to use the weighted-sum method on each gene , and combine the resulting p-values ( π1 , … , πG ) with the Fisher product test statisticSince π1 , … , πG are i.i.d. uniformly ( 0 , 1 ) distributed under the null-hypothesis , T is χ2-distributed with 2G degrees of freedom , and can be evaluated accordingly [ 42 ] , [ 43 ] .
This method allows for fast analysis of different pathways , using the results from the gene-analysis , and can thereby assist in the functional analysis of a disease association study .
--
Genomic DNA gel blot analysis with probes derived from different ΨSRKs was used to assess the composition of the S locus in various accessions of A. thaliana .
This method is more suitable than amplification by the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) for our study because of the known or expected sequence divergence of the loci under study .
--
A genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) enables a systematic search of the entire genome for genetic factors that cause any inherited trait .
This method has successfully identified susceptibility loci for common diseases [ 9 ] , and is beginning to be applied to pharmacogenomics .
--
Therefore , we measured the colocalization of markers for DNA damage and repair with ‘DAPI-bright’ and ‘DAPI-weak’ regions of interphase cells ( Figure 1B ) .
This method of quantitation is conservative ; it underestimates the amount of damage in heterochromatin , because some heterochromatic sequences are present in DAPI-weak regions .
--
For the ABC procedure , we used the following summary statistics : S , π , Tajima 's D , Fu & Li 's D* for each population group and pairwise FST and for each pair of population groups .
This method was demonstrated to be accurate by estimating IM parameters for 100 simulated datasets for which the IM parameters were specified .
--
Lastly , we apply the analytical best-tag Bonferroni method [ 19 ] - [ 21 ] which uses the Bonferroni correction for the per-marker threshold and estimates power for each causal SNP by using the most correlated marker ( best tag SNP ) .
This method can also be accelerated by sampling the causal SNPs and setting a window size .
--
Neighboring segments of PHASEd-piCHM haplotypes were linked by referring to the phases of CHM at heterozygous sites that were nearest to the segment ends .
This method of segment phasing is not as strict as that employed in PHASElink [ 9 ] .
( Although exceptions occur , they are infrequent and tend to occur at the extreme downstream end of a gene. ) The first method was based in part on the average relative frequencies of CT and non-CT BPSs in a handful of spectra and provided a correction factor for base substitutions of 4.726 [ 6 ] .
This method was used for almost all of the entries in Table 1 ; however , the range of values averaging to 4.726 was large , reducing reliability .
--
We have developed a new algorithm to infer the expression change of each mRNA isoform of a gene based on the microarray measurements .
This method is of general utility for interpreting splicing-sensitive microarrays and high-throughput sequence data .
--
Splicing-sensitive microarrays have been used successfully to assay alternative splicing on a global scale ( reviewed in [ 26 ] ) .
This method has been applied in fly to assess global splicing changes when splicing factors are inhibited or overexpressed and to measure sexually dimorphic splicing [ 27 ] - [ 29 ] .
--
We propose an alternate method to identify clusters of translation rate-limiting codons that may be of functional importance in human genes .
This method is free from local nucleotide biases and assumptions about the usage of codons throughout the genome .
--
Tissues were accepted as specific for a gene if they exhibited expression greater than or equal to the median expression plus 7.5 IQRs .
This method allows us to capture multiple tissues in which expression is relatively high , irrespective of overall expression level , as well as controlling for the distribution of expression values ( e.g. taking as a cut-off value a multiple of the average will suffer from genes with large IQR ) .
--
Therefore , we also performed a second analysis using repeated records on the same child , one for each full age year recorded ( method 2 ) , in which we fitted a multivariate model treating each age year as a separate , but correlated , trait ( that is , 11 traits for age years 0-10 ) .
This method thus allowed h2 and c2 to vary across age groups : it also yielded estimates of genetic and environmental correlations in incidence between age groups .
--
First ( method 3 ) , we compared the incidence of malaria admissions to hospital among affected full-sibs to that in the general , unrelated , population : a difference in incidence among relatives reflects a genetic component in the trait on the underlying scale and thus allows an estimation of its heritability [ 13 ] .
This method does not allow for incorporation of fixed effects into the analysis , or for separation of h2 from c2 , but does provide an easy way of calculating an upper limit to heritability from incidence data .
--
To assess the effect of PM at delivery on the probability of infant parasitemia throughout infancy , generalized estimating equations logistic regression models were constructed with a first-order autoregressive working correlation structure ( the analysis with exchangeable and m-dependent correlation structure produced nearly identical results for the data ) and model-based standard errors [ 20 ] .
This method allowed full use of the data while accounting for the correlation of repeated measurements over time .

It is of concern that the authors did not directly measure the flies ' total food intake but only estimated intake by examining their feeding behavior .
This method may not take into account possible differences in the rate of food uptake of restricted flies , which could affect the results .
--
A previous method has been described in detail to convert logistic regression models into a Bayesian format [ 15 ] .
This method provides identical results to our method for simple models .
--
Informing participants that deception will occur ( particularly in a study that involves administration of a placebo ) is apt to make them suspicious and wary , thus possibly contributing to biased data .
This methodological risk is avoided in most deceptive research , which does not employ this technique , provided that prospective participants do not otherwise suspect that deception will be used .
--
Alternatively , β can be estimated algebraically by approximating R0 roughly using the average age at first infection ( A ) and the mean lifetime of the population ( L ) in endemic areas .

One method for reducing such overconfidence is to first expose participants to a single example of misleading drug or device promotion , allow them to express unjustified beliefs , debunk those beliefs , and then finally explain the misleading techniques that were used .
This method enables participants to understand that they are personally vulnerable to being misled by promotion [ 18 , 27 ] .

--
The random walk method was used to select households .
This method may have introduced bias causing overestimation or underestimation of trachoma prevalence at the individual village level , but is likely to have affected the overall prevalence estimates to a lesser extent because these were calculated from 22 villages [ 14 ] .
--
Children are examined until either a predetermined number of cases with active disease is identified ( high prevalence ) or a total of 50 children are sampled without the cut-off point being reached ( low prevalence ) .
This method has the benefit of allowing the survey to stop as soon as it has sufficient information about the likely prevalence of trachoma to allow an intervention strategy to be planned .

This method assumes the markers to be a random selection of the polymorphisms in the gene .
--
Because we selected the partners of the cases as control individuals , and because it turned out , as expected , that couples tend to travel together , we performed a conditional logistic regression analysis to calculate odds ratios ( ORs ) for the relation between travel and venous thrombosis .
This method fully takes this matching into account , and leads to unbiased estimates , with adjustment for all factors in which cases and controls tend to be similar , e.g. , socioeconomic class [ 14 ] .
--
Therefore , we performed a case-only analysis [ 15 ] .
This method allows one to examine the association between two exposures among case individuals only .

To evaluate the number of false positives ( due to multiple testing ) , we used a Monte Carlo approach ( implemented in BRB comparison tool ) based on 1,000 random sample label permutations .
This method calculates the false discovery rate ( with a probability of 90 % ) , on the basis of the number ( n ) of probe sets ( n first probe sets ordered by their p-value from the univariate test ) identified where the false discovery is relative to the chosen level of significance for the univariate test ( e.g. , p = 0.001 ) .
This method also evaluates the number n′ of probe sets ( n′ first probe sets ordered by their p-value from the univariate test ) for which the number of false discoveries is less than 10 ( with a probability of 90 % ) .

We used the HOMA calculator ( Oxford Centre for Diabetes , Endocrinology & Metabolism , Diabetes Trials Unit , http : / / www.dtu.ox.ac.uk / ) to compute a measure of insulin sensitivity ( HOMA-S ) using fasting glucose and insulin [ 20 ] .
This method of calculating HOMA uses a corrected formula that is believed to be a more accurate reflection of insulin sensitivity than the older method [ 20 ] .
--
The results are obtained by averaging across the results from each of these datasets using Rubin 's rules , and the procedure takes account of uncertainty in the imputation as well as uncertainty due to random variation ( as undertaken in all multivariable analyses ) [ 24 ] .
This method assumes that data are either “missing completely at random” or are “missing at random , ” but are not “missing not at random” ( i.e. , it assumes that the probability of missing data does not depend on the outcome of interest ) .

This gives an estimated probability that these findings represent a true finding of at least 92 % ( FPRP < 0.08 ) .
This method is designed to avoid over-interpretation of statistically significant findings that are not likely to signify a true positive .

--
Household sampling within clusters usually relies on a technique known as “spin-the-pen , ” whereby a household along an imaginary line running from the centre to the edge of the community is sampled first , and further households are selected through a proximity rule ( e.g. , next closest ) .
This method can entail selection bias and reduce precision ; alternatives include sampling random GPS coordinates [ 22 ] or mapping a segment of the community and doing systematic sampling therein [ 17 ] .

For inferring functional linkages from DNA microarray evidence , we employ the divide-test-integrate approach [ 1 ] for discovering functionally informative cases of mRNA co-expression .
This method is in contrast to simply concatenating the results of all DNA microarray experiments to create a single , monolithic expression vector for each gene , then measuring correlation between these vectors .
--
Therefore , the effect of lower sample sizes , if any , will be to reject real similarity in patterns of integration and to reduce the significance of results , rather than to create false similarity and increase significances .
This methodology is thus more conservative and would impact all analyses for phylogeny and diet equally .

The ready availability of dense marker maps and physical positions as well as genetic positions for markers facilitates incorporation of positional information .

In this longitudinal retrospective ( 01 / 1996-06 / 2004 ) investigation , diarrhea , acute respiratory infection of the lower tract , and malaria consultation time-series are fitted with a general-purpose econometric method , namely the multiplicative Holt-Winters , to produce contemporaneous on-line forecasts for the district of Niono , Mali .
This method accommodates seasonal , as well as inter-annual , fluctuations and produces reasonably accurate median 2- and 3-month horizon forecasts for these non-stationary time-series , i.e. , 92 % of the 24 time-series forecasts generated ( 2 forecast horizons , 3 diseases , and 4 age categories = 24 time-series forecasts ) have mean absolute percentage errors circa 25 % .

The MHW method is extensively described in the Methods section and schematically depicted in Figure 2 .
This method ignores direct effects from climate ( e.g. , AD and ITCZ ) on disease TS .
Nevertheless , MHW-based historical TS analyses can obliquely capture non-linear prior interactions between climate and the aforementioned disease dynamics thus , potentially obviating the need for more complex disease-specific climate-based parametric forecasting methods ( which are otherwise indispensable for highly-unstable transmission and or spatially-extended infectious disease models ) in the district of Niono .
This method could directly improve infectious disease management in this district with potential repercussions elsewhere in the Sahel where quantitative approaches may assist with predicting and containing infectious disease-induced morbidity and mortality .
--
Thus , this public health pursuit is herein addressed with the MHW forecasting method .
This method i ) adapts to underlying alterations in disease TS dynamics and ii ) predicts disease TS with distinct epidemiological signatures ( diarrhea : oral-fecal transmission ; ARI : conjunctival , nasal , or oral transmission ; malaria : vector transmission ) as confirmed by Figs .
--
The MHW method captures these interactions ( under partially- or fully-stable transmission ) , decomposing highly non-linear TS features ( e.g. , seasonal components ) and hence , ascribing a non-linear ‘flavor’ to disease TS forecasts .
This method also de-correlates { lt } , { rt } , { sm|t } , and { zt } features , which may be employed to investigate long-term disease TS trend and seasonality .

Thus , the data obtained by lectin staining with excess probe were suitable for determining the mean fluorescence intensity ( MFI ) of lectin staining .
This method compared the relative glycan expression profiles of cell lines whose cellular size and character might not be uniform ; therefore , we normalized the staining signal by using the ratio of the stained sample MFI to the control MFI .
--
We estimated marker location-specific ancestry using the HMM , in which the transmission probability was calculated based on the continuous gene flow ( CGF ) model [ 21 ] , [ 25 ] .
This method directly maximizes the likelihood function through an EM iterative algorithm and allows consideration of uncertainty of marker allele frequencies in the parental populations [ 25 ] .

Thus , the “antisense” cA1 peptide was a candidate for an antigenic homolog of both B1 peptide and gp120 envelop proteins of HIV-1 .
This method was used to induce cellular immunity against HIV-1 and was validated in immunized rabbits as well as in T lymphocytes originated from HIV-1 infected and envelope-immunized individuals .

Heteroduplexes are isolated , separated on polyacrylamide gels , and quantified using Southern blots for heteroduplex analysis .
This method reveals that heteroduplexes are still found in either 5′ or 3′ DNA strands in approximately equal amounts , even in the absence of orf and rap .
--
Images were acquired in 5 minutes or less , and were quantified using AlphaEase software ( Alpha Innotech ) .
This method has been shown to be quantitative [ 41 ] - [ 43 ] .
--
This study employed physical analyses of heteroduplex DNAs using a loop-strand conformation to separate , on polyacrylamide gels , heteroduplex DNAs with an 18 nt loop in either the 5′ or 3′ strand .
This method was used to analyze patches formed in vivo by RecBCD-mediated DSE-repair recombination of phage λ with the λ-homologous plasmid , λdv , and analyzed patches inserted into the plasmid .
--
The system for heteroduplex analysis described here utilizes several commonly performed methods , with a few modifications , to create , isolate , and detect heteroduplexes formed in vivo .
This method can be used with many different strain backgrounds to test effects on recombination between λ and λdv .
--
In this context we proposed a fast two-step method called Genome-wide Association using Mixed Model and Regression ( GRAMMAR ) for the analysis of pedigree-based quantitative traits .
This method certainly overcomes the drawback of time limitation of the measured genotype ( MG ) approach , but pays in power .
--
We propose use of GC to correct for conservativeness of the GRAMMAR approach outlined earlier .
This method which we call GRAMMAR-GC involves three steps : ( a ) trait heritability is estimated by using trait and pedigree data using the following mixed modelwhere βj is the effect of jth covariate , cij is the value of jth covariate and μ , G , and e are defined earlier .
--
In the space-time permutation scan statistic , the time window is varied at time spans ranging from one month to six months and anchored on the last month of the time window , using data restricted up to that point .
This methodology provides a pseudo-real time scan , prospectively , where it is assumed that data is only available up to the point of running the space-time permutation scan statistic .
--
As predicted , phagocytosis of yeast was inhibited for neutrophils treated with the non-hydrolyzable cAMP analog 8-bromo-cAMP [ 1 µM ; ANOVA : p < 0.001 ] .
This method discriminates between FITC-stained HKO C. albicans engulfed by the neutrophils and those that are simply adherent to the outer neutrophil membrane .
--
However , differences were apparent when the extracts were resolved on TLC plates impregnated with silver nitrate .
This method of argentation TLC retards the migration of unsaturated FAMEs and MAMEs [ 33 ] .
--
We confirmed the tree by repeating the analysis using Bayesian methods as implemented in mrBayes 3.0 [ 30 ] , under the same model of nucleotide substitution .
This method produced the same tree topology , and similar or even stronger support for internal branches , as evaluated by posterior probabilities derived from trees sampled every 500 generations from a 10-million generations Markov Chain Monte Carlo series , with a burn-in time of 250000 generations that removed any trees generated before convergence had been reached .
--
In this analysis , we randomly shuffled the case-control status among individuals multiple times , and estimated how frequently a P-value < 0.02 was obtained from the randomly permutated data .
This method also accounts for the testing of multiple genetic models with each SNP .
--
Using PCR to amplify ≈220 bp of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase I , and 250-345 bp fragments of the multi-copy , nuclear 28s ribosomal DNA gene , we demonstrate the efficacy of this method on beetles collected up to 50 years ago .
This method offers a means of obtaining useful genetic information from rare insects without conferring external morphological damage .
--
Significant topographical differences in hd-EEG power during the first 30 min NREM sleep were assessed by statistical nonparametric mapping ( SnPM ) [ 6 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 45 ] .
This method takes advantage of the actual data distribution and accounts for multiple comparisons testing in hd-EEG recordings .
--
The fold induction is 2-ΔΔCt .
This method requires that the PCR amplification efficiencies of all genes be similar and preferably at or above 90 % .
--
In addition to the automatic recording of bat activity , a 30 minute transect was carried out at each sampling site using a bat detector ( S-25 Ultrasound Advice , London ) set to frequency division mode .
This method of ultrasound transformation allows calls to be recorded in real time on audiocassettes and the number of recorded passes provides a quantitative assessment of bat activity [ 30 ] .
--
The method used here to estimate the reproductive number and generation time parameters is an extension of that developed by Wallinga and Teunis [ 19 ] for the SARS-epidemic .
This method requires only time-series data for an outbreak , and is therefore easily applied even in real-time .
--
Haptoglobin was genotyped by allele-specific PCR adapted from a method published by Koch et al. [ 37 ] .
This method determines the Hp1 and Hp2 alleles but does not distinguish between the “F” and “S” subtypes of the Hp1 and Hp2 alleles and therefore avoids potential misclassification based on the presence of different combinations of these sub-types [ 38 ] .
--
The standardized nearest neighbour distance method was used to describe the degree of spatial clustering of the A and B cell distributions obtained in the “extrinsic” and “intrinsic” models .
This method uses the average distance from every cell to its nearest neighbour to determine if the cells are clustered , distributed homogenously or dispersed .
--
The map of the LINE-1 promoter with primers and probe positions is presented in Figure 1A .
This method relies on bisulfite treatment of DNA which modifies unmethylated cytosines to tymidines while methylated cytosines are non-reactive .
--
A simple , non-parametric and efficient method to compute the class membership is to assign each data point to the closest cluster .
This method , however , has the disadvantage of leaving the class probabilities undefined and of giving equal performance marks to points that are at different distances away from their corresponding assigned clusters .
--
We describe a new way of performing the regularization step that allows us to select a parameter in such a way that it improves the generalization , by looking for minimization of class errors not only for the self-class , but also for other classes and in-between classes .
This method performs fairly well for both the experimental and simulated data sets , yielding increased generalization performances for MDA and MGD methods described here .
--
The family-based association study was carried out mainly according to the method implemented in the FBAT program [ 54 ] , which combines these three different methods ( TDT , RC-TDT , and Sib-TDT ) .
This method also allows the use of an empirical variance-covariance estimator for the statistic , which is consistent when sibling marker genotypes are correlated ( e.g. when the analysis includes multiple affected sibs ) [ 55 ] .
--
The whole cell approach also allows for an analysis in time of distinct entry intermediates , a study that is currently under investigation .
This method can now be used to study in three dimensions , over time , the interactions of many pathogens with their hosts , to observe structural and time-dependent cellular and viral rearrangements .
--
This wide range of coverage makes it advantageous to discover unlinked common SNPs in coding and non-coding regions by screening one or only a few animals .
This method of SNP identification is unique because it can be used to identify SNPs distant from any genes .
--
We have developed a method based on broad-range RT-PCR followed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry ( RT-PCR / ESI-MS ) for rapid and accurate detection of influenza virus , sub-species characterization , and early identification of genetic changes in circulating viruses .
This method has previously been applied to detection of other pathogens in human clinical samples [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , but it has unique capabilities and advantages for influenza surveillance .
--
We tested this hypothesis by inducing secretion using flash photolysis of caged Ca2+ .
This method allowed us to raise [ Ca2+ ] i homogenously in the cell in a stepwise manner .
--
Phylogenetic footprinting is a powerful approach for discovering putative gene regulatory regions .
This method generally relies on alignments of orthologous , non-coding sequences from multiple species [ 51 ] .
--
GOstat ( http : / / gostat.wehi.edu.au / ) was used to examine selected sets of probesets for over- and under-representation of GO terms , using MGI ( http : / / www.informatics.jax.org / mgihome / ) as GO to gene association database , and using false discovery rate correction .
This method is sensitive to the GO annotations attached to the genes related to the probes , thus the result might change if another database ( e.g. GOA ) is used .
--
The Product of Approximate Conditionals model of Li and Stephens [ 13 ] was used to further investigate the recombination rate over the entire region and over the proposed non-recombining block ( DSX1012 , DXS1002 DXS225 , DXS1019 and DXS8114 ) .
This method depends on using a fixed value for the scaled population mutation rate , ϑ which Li and Stephens [ 13 ] call . Values for from 10 to 60 were investigated , consistent with known microsatellite mutation rates and effective population size for the X chromosome .
--
The null hypothesis is rejected for all comparisons with P-values≤Pk .
This method has greatly increased power over procedures that control the probability of rejecting any null hypotheses , such as Bonferroni corrections , particularly when dealing with small sample sizes [ 41 ] , [ 42 ] .
--
The resulting differences are independent , allowing for regression tests between two traits .
This method is effective and well used , but is appropriate only for continuous data .
--
To test whether coincidence between the two predictions of refugial locations was better than random , we analyzed spatial correlations using the method of Dutilleul [ 66 ] , as implemented in Spatial Analysis in Macroecology ( SAM ) [ 67 ] .
This method adjusts the degrees of freedom in a correlation analysis based on measures of spatial autocorrelation in both datasets .
--
For the mouse data , additional parameters for batch effect were added ( see [ 7 ] ) .
This method is more general and flexible than the correlation approach of Hsieh et al. [ 8 ] .
--
Recently , a method has been described to produce anucleate fission yeast cells [ 8 ] - [ 10 ] .
This method employs centrifugation to misplace the nucleus in asynchronously growing cells .
--
Therefore , we used traditional and phylogenetically-controlled analysis of variance to test for a relationship between extinction risk and dietary breadth [ 3 ] .
This method is well suited to analyzing differences within continuous variables between categorical groups [ 19 ] .
--
Fecal analysis is a common method for quantifying the diet of insectivorous bats .
This method has received some criticism because of problems caused by differential digestion and the difficulty of accurately identifying insect remains [ 23 ] .
Detection of genes that provided clustering similar to viral titer based clustering of patients was performed by a mathematical method similar to the mirror tree method for inferring protein interactions from phylogenetic distance matrices [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] .
This method was applied to gene expression and linked the gene-specific variability of patients with their viral titer variability .
--
This is based on correlation with decrease in virus titer .
This method has broad utility and can be used to analyze response to any group of factors influencing biological outcome .

This method did not predict all known in vivo Cdc28 substrates [ Supplementary Table S2 reviews and references known Cdc28 substrates ] .
--
Chromosomal mapping and analysis was performed using an in-house algorithm ( see supplementary information for details ) .
This method was designed for use with Affymetrix data and so CodeLink probe IDs were first mapped to Affymetrix probe-set IDs using Onto-Translate [ 6 ] .
--
Such a low rate of photobleaching suggests that a significant improvement in fluorescence yield could be achieved with a more powerful laser .
This method of measuring transmembrane voltage therefore holds the promise of reaching signal-to-noise ratios comparable to those achieved with quiet cameras and widefield illumination [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] while benefiting from all the advantages of two-photon excitation : the ability to see much deeper into tissue than with widefield single-photon excitation ( Figure 3d ) , as well as relative insensitivity to tissue autofluorescence and out-of-focus labeling resulting from the optical sectioning inherent in non-linear absorption .
--
Since the axon withdrawal is reversible—if one of the supersynapses dips below ΘS—continuing to track the strength is a way for the system to have some memory of its past configuration , though that memory should fade in time if the neuron remains saturated for a long time .
This method was chosen because withdrawals in the network occur instantaneously rather than through a more realistic gradual process .
--
Telschow et al. [ 26 ] determined analytically critical migration rates in a two population model with bidirectional CI using standard fixpoint analysis .
This method can be applied to unidirectional CI if no viability selection at the trait locus is considered ( for details see [ 37 ] ) .
--
A flow diagram of the study is presented in Fig. 1 .
This method was described in detail elsewhere [ 11 ] .
--
In order to ensure that the obtained correlations are not due to phylogenetic relatedness , we employed a method that takes into account the topology and branch lengths of the phylogenetic tree relating the analyzed species ( Fig. 2 ) .
This methodology implements a generalized least squares ( GLS ) model and likelihood ratio tests to resolve whether correlation between two characters is dependent on the underlying phylogeny [ 31 ] , [ 32 ] .
--
We were able to make robust inferences about the history of the H. binoei complex in relation to climatic cycles by combining population genetic approaches with climatic and biophysical distribution modeling .
This methodology should also be very valuable for understanding the prevalence of hybrid parthenogenesis in the Australian arid zone , and for addressing the role of abiotic factors in the formation , spread , and persistence of parthenogenetic lineages more generally .
--
Dating of NCPA inferences was performed using the method of Templeton [ 20 ] .
This method allows for calculation of a point estimate for the age of a given event , and a confidence interval around that estimate that accounts for evolutionary stochasticity by modeling the distribution of time to coalescence as a gamma function [ 59 ] .
--
MODELLER produces comparative models satisfying spatial restraints with simultaneous optimization of CHARMM energies [ 34 ] .
This method uses conjugate gradients and molecular dynamics with simulated annealing [ 33 ] .
--
Therefore , we used the Lomb-Scargle Fourier Transform ( LS ) [ 34 ] , [ 35 ] to reanalyze the data used by [ 1 ] .
This method is more appropriate because it does not require evenly spaced samples .
--
Perhaps the most reliable reported method for measurement of Dam activity involved monitoring the incorporation of a 3H labelled methyl group ( transferred from 3H labelled AdoMet ) to an adenine residue within a DNA substrate , typically either calf thymus DNA [ 14 ] or a short double stranded oligonucleotide [ 15 ] .
This method has allowed the kinetic analysis of a number of DNA adenine methyltransferases , including that from E. coli [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , bacteriophage T2 [ 18 ] and bacteriophage T4 [ 19 ] , but using this type of discontinuous assay for detailed kinetic studies is labour intensive .
--
Then , to capture more of the detail that micro-simulations have shown is important in outbreak dynamics , I analyse a model of transmission within and between households , and develop a method to estimate the household reproduction number , defined as the number of households infected by each infected household .
This method is validated by numerical simulations of the spread of influenza and measles using historical data , and estimates are obtained for would-be emerging epidemics of these viruses .
--
We have shown that OPT can be used to image the structure within the intact head after efficient bleaching and clearing .
This method may also assist confocal microscopy , where at present dissection is necessary as the exoskelton prevents visualization of the CNS .
--
We have also shown that this processing procedure can be used to image with the confocal the brain from within the head capsule .
This method could also be used to create a reference brain from mapping gene expression patterns and can give detailed images that show neuroanatomical structures such as the fan shaped body and ellipsoid body .
--
We used the single section disector method to estimate the size and number of vesicles contained in a random sample of labeled prefrontal cortico-thalamic boutons ( n = 19 ) .
This method assumes that if an object that appears in one section has a major diameter much smaller than the section thickness it would rarely appear in the following sections [ 99 ] .
--
Individual lipid molecules are randomly selected from a lipid library that contains various conformations of lipid molecules .
This method allows one to easily control the system size and the number of lipid molecules while it generates a lipid bilayer nicely packed around the protein .
--
In general , weak repulsive radial forces perpendicular to the membrane normal are applied to a lipid bilayer until the hole is large enough to accommodate the protein .
This method provides a well-equilibrated lipid bilayer , and one might expect less equilibration time than in the first method .
--
A different approach based on the spectral difference of the LFP ( local field potential ) signal has been recently proposed to distinguish between up and down states [ 34 ] .
This method also relies on the bimodal distribution of the membrane potential .
--
Therefore the ITD can be used to assess which species , densities and sizes of trees are consistent with a given sample of LIDAR returns .
This method would engage with the whole sample of return heights , rather than summary statistics such as the mean height .
--
To avoid this problem , and to measure the actual power of each variable , we used multimodal inference based on all-subsets selection of generalised linear mixed effects models ( GLMM ) ( [ 53 ] ) .
This method has been proven to be more robust and useful than stepwise regression [ 53 ] - [ 55 ] , and allows the measurement of the weight of evidence with which each explanatory variable explains the response variable [ 53 ] .
--
One method expresses compound abundances as a proportion of the total abundance ( TA ) for a fly .
This method , which we call Relative Abundance ( RA ) , succeeds at reducing error variances for many compounds and has the virtue of great simplicity .
--
Note that method ( c ) , weighted mean abundance , would be more appropriate in studies focused on methyl-alkanes and n-alkanes .
This method allows less abundant compounds to contribute more to score estimates , which is also true of log-based methods such as logcontrast .
--
The Significance Analysis of Microarrays ( SAM ) program [ 23 ] , which evaluates the distribution of the t statistic with numerous random permutations of group assignments ( male vs. female in this study ) , indicated that there were more than 3,000 sex-related differences when limiting the false discovery rate to 5 % .
This method did not account for age as a source of variance , so we used analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) as the primary method to rank genes according to the likelihood that there is a sex difference in expression after accounting for overall age effects ( which have been reported previously ) .
--
The gene expression database was examined for differential expression in men and women after re-calculating expression scores with the GCRMA method [ 52 ] as implemented by ArrayAssist Lite software ( Stratagene , Version 3.3 ) .
This method was chosen after comparing it the standard Affymetrix method , a modified version of the Affymetrix comparison analysis algorithm that was used for our analyses of age-related differences [ 53 ] , and RMA [ 54 ] , because it had the best performance in accounting for non-specific hybridization ( expression scores in women close to zero for Y chromosome genes ; in men close to zero for XIST gene ) and had the highest correlation with quantitative RT-PCR for mean age-related differences across 8 different transcripts ( r = 0.83 ) .
--
The Limma Bioconductor library developed by Gordon Smyth et al. [ 71 ] was used for the detection of differentially expressed genes .
This method is based on the fitting of a linear model to estimate the variability in the data .
--
Unlike prevalence and case reporting data , STARHS effectively differentiates between RI individuals , defined by infection occurring on average within the previous 170 days , and those with longstanding or chronic infection [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] .
This method , therefore , allows us to construct a more explicit map of the leading edge of the epidemic .
--
The combination of quantitative trait locus ( QTL ) mapping and gene expression profiling allows for the identification of expression quantitative trait loci ( eQTLs ) , which are loci associated with the expression of each transcript .
This method was first applied to a yeast strain intercross , where both cis-acting and trans-acting loci were identified associated with the expression level of hundreds of transcripts [ 1 ] .
--
eQTLs have also been described using human lymphoblastoid cell lines from defined pedigrees [ 2 ] - [ 4 ] .
This methodology has been used , in so-called ‘genetical-genomics’ studies [ 5 ] , as an aid to identify candidate genes for complex phenotypic traits , such as obesity , in mouse strain intercross studies [ 6 ] - [ 9 ] ; and , it has been a major shortcut in the identification of QTL causative genes , for example the identification of ABCC6 as the gene responsible for dystrophic cardiac calcification in DBA / 2 mice [ 10 ] .
--
Using the GMR-hid ey-FLP ( GheF ) method [ 44 ] , we conducted an EMS-mutagenesis screen for chromosome arm 3L to identify recessive suppressors of the GMR-hid eye ablation phenotype .
This method induces homozygous mutant clones in the eye by ey-FLP / FRT-mediated mitotic recombination in otherwise heterozygous background [ 61 ] .
--
Second , we used the Bayesian clustering algorithm implemented in Structure 2.1 [ 69 ] , [ 70 ] .
This method relies on the Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chain ( MCMC ) approach to cluster individuals into K distinct populations that minimize Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium and gametic phase disequilibrium between loci within groups .
--
Recently , cells attached to a substrate were imaged for long period [ 8 ] .
This method allows media exchange , but daughter cells may bud upwards and be lost .
--
A novel and efficient tagArray technology was developed that allows rapid identification of antibodies which bind to receptors with a specific expression profile , in the absence of biological information .
This method is based on the cloning of a specific , short nucleotide sequence ( tag ) in the phagemid coding for each phage-displayed antibody fragment ( phage-Ab ) present in a library .
--
Capitalizing on DNA-based technology , the Membranome phage-Ab collection offers a complementary approach to standard proteomic analysis by applying unmatched throughput and high sensitivity of microarray technology to protein expression analysis .
This method provides a comprehensive multiplexed readout ( > 20,000 data points ) of the expression of receptors displayed on the cell surface , and allows highly sensitive monitoring of their variations .
--
In our analysis , we also implement the method described by [ 12 ] ( hereafter referred to as the Garske et al. method ) and compare the results of the two methodologies .
This method first estimates the generation time distribution using a likelihood based method .
--
It is important to point out that the WT method of fitting the effective reproductive model over fits the model and suffers from generalizeability .
This method essentially traces the epidemic curve , lagged by the mean of the generation time distribution .
--
Parasite growth rates were calculated using a method previously described [ 18 ] .
This method is based on a statistical model of parasite distribution , using a convolution of two probability density functions to estimate the numbers of parasites present in the blood and being sequestered at any time .
--
Here we introduce a method of electroporation in early postnatal animals that requires neither surgery nor stereotaxic apparatus , but which results in widespread expression of foreign genes in specific cell populations , with nearly 100 % success rates .
This methodology makes genetic manipulation in rodents a bench top procedure , bringing it within the technical and financial reach of most laboratories .
--
Based on the hypergeometric distribution , we calculated the probability ( p-value ) of randomly observing each GO term enrichment or depletion value [ 43 ] , [ 45 ] .
This method is one of several that facilitate distinguishing statistically significant patterns in data [ 46 ] .
--
There are several methods that can be used to solve this matrix including simply solving for each of these coefficients or using methods such as the Levinson , Wiggins , and Robertson 's method or Morf 's method [ 31 ] , used for this analysis .
This method can be used to estimate the multivariate AR model for any model order m .
--
Thus , this method allows the two examples stated earlier to be easily differentiable .
This method is , however , computationally expensive and may be impractical with very large electrode arrays due to the combinatorial number combinations that must be addressed .
--
We sought to confirm this hypothesis by directly imaging the interaction between ROCK1 and LIMK2 in blebbing and non-blebbing cells using FRET : FLIM microscopy .
This method not only allows an interaction between ROCK1 and LIMK2 to be detected but also the localisation of such an interaction to be determined spatially across the whole cell .
--
To predict whether a nonsense SNP causes NMD , we examined whether a nonsense SNP is located in the 3′ side of the boundary , which was set at 50 nucleotides upstream from the end of the second to last exon , in the exon-intron structure .
This method is the same as the method in SNP2NMD [ 37 ] when ‘NMD distance’ is 50 nucleotides .
--
Because active enhancers are known to be located in open chromatin regions and thereby show DNase I hypersensitivity , we used a real-time PCR-based approach to assess the integrity of the CNS2 in DNase I treated nuclei prepared from NHEKs [ 24 ] .
This method had been reported efficient to query the nuclease sensitivity of candidate segments [ 33 ] , [ 34 ] or to build comprehensive maps of open chromatin sites at the genomic or chromosomic levels [ 35 ] , [ 36 ] .
--
This step is followed by specific 16S rRNA directed fluorescent in situ hybridization .
This method allows the specific detection of viable and cultivable and viable but non-cultivable ( VBNC ) bacteria .

Plasma viral load was measured by the California Department of Health Services , Viral and Rickettsial Disease Laboratory using the Roche COBAS HIV-1 Monitor v1.5 test .
This method has a sensitivity cutoff of 50 HIV-1 RNA copies per ml plasma .
--
The diagnosis of CaP is conventionally obtained by saturation prostate biopsy and morphological examination of tissue sections .
This method is reliable , but requires careful training .
--
To identify redundant subsequences among the regions that belong to known families , FastBLAST uses a greedy approach to identify clusters of similar sequences .
This method is similar to CD-HIT , but instead of counting k-mers , FastBLAST estimates sequence identity from the multiple sequence alignment .
--
We therefore utilised a protocol first extracting in CHAPS to release DG from the membrane , followed by a triton extraction step to precipitate the cytoskeleton and associated proteins in the triton insoluble fraction .
This method has been employed with previous success to extract ERM family proteins and dystroglycan [ 48 ] , [ 49 ] .
--
Based on this property , a cloning strategy called ‘Golden Gate’ cloning was devised that allows to obtain in one tube and one step close to one hundred percent correct recombinant plasmids after just a 5 minute restriction-ligation .
This method is therefore as efficient as currently used recombination-based cloning technologies but yields recombinant plasmids that do not contain unwanted sequences in the final construct , thus providing precision for this fundamental process of genetic manipulation .
--
For further investigation , individuals with one of the following criteria were excluded : taking medications known to affect glucose tolerance , severe diseases ( malignancies , cardiovascular or psychiatric disease , etc. ) , newly diagnosed diabetes , positive GAD antibodies , and one or more missing parameters needed for AUCCP / AUCGlc calculation .
This method of elimination resulted in a final study cohort of 725 non-diabetic individuals .
--
In this approximation , the likelihood of the observed set of polymorphisms for each segment with a local value of the recombination rate is estimated by importance sampling over the distribution of the ancestral recombination graphs [ 45 ] .
This method , by explicitly modeling the evolution of each sequence segment in the presence of recombination and mutation , provides estimates of the recombination rates that are not artificially inflated by the presence of related sequences in the dataset .
--
In our culture system , the axons are many times longer than dendrites , and are of comparably thin and constant diameter along their length with no spines and regular actin-rich variscosities along their length [ 1 ] .
This method was determined to be ∼90 % accurate as demonstrated by post-experiment immunostaining for the axonal marker tau-1 ( Millipore , Billerica , MA ) .
--
To infer the DNA concentration and to assess the presence of protein inhibitors , the 260 and 280 nm absorbance was measured using 1μl in a NanoDropTM 1000 Spectrophotometer .
This method is only effective for concentrations greater than 5 ng / μl ( from laboratory experience ) and will not evaluate molecular weights .
--
All the qPCR set up was performed in the ancient laboratory in order to avoid external contamination .
This method provides accurate estimates of the number of molecules of a specific locus .
--
Here we report such a methodology ( Microarrays-before-Sequencing , Mab-seq ) , which should also be of interest to investigators using chromatin immunoprecipitations who are working primarily with microarrays , but wish to bank material for later genome-wide interrogations .

This method was chosen instead of our previously used invasive method because it might offer several potential advantages : it is technically less demanding , it allows repeated measurements over a long period and it avoids the use of anaesthetic and mechanical ventilation .
However , one possible disadvantage is that one can not rule out a contribution by the nose and upper respiratory tract to the parameters measured .
This method of antigen-induced airway inflammation and AHR is very similar to that of Dohi et al. [ 9 ] in which they report a strong correlation between Penh and eosinophil number in bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) fluid .
