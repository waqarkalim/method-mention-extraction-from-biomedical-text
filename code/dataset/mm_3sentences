Aliquots were withdrawn at different time points and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 90 min with a 10 kDa cut-off Microcon™ filter .
The conjugated R.I.CK ( fluorescein ) -Tat9 was retained in the filter as retentates and separated from the cleaved free R.I.CK ( fluorescein ) -Tat9 that passed through the filter .
Thereafter , the fluorescence of conjugated R.I.CK ( fluorescein ) -Tat9 was measured using a Tecan fluorescence microplate reader with an excitation wavelength at 485 nm and an emission wavelength at 535 nm .
This method was used rather than measuring fluorescence in the flow-through , since the concentration of cleaved R.I.CK ( fluorescein ) -Tat9 could not be quantified due a high degree of adsorption caused by its positive charges ( unpublished data ) .

In order to calculate the absolute CD4 T-cell cell count , a complete blood cell count must be done to determine the absolute white blood cell count .
The absolute white blood cell number per microliter must then be multiplied by the fraction of white blood cells which are lymphocytes as determined by a manual differential count .
The resulting lymphocyte count per microliter is multiplied by the measured CD4 percentage to yield an absolute CD4 count per microliter of blood .
This method introduces two sources of measurement errors ( WBC measurement and differential count ) .

In order to apply this method to tissue development and regenerative medical research , however , the film method procedure needs adjusting .
For instance , since this film method can prepare 2- to 50-µm-thick fresh-frozen sections , section thickness should be modified to reflect the experimental purpose .
Specifically , Kawamoto and Shimizu recommend 5- to 10-µm-thick sections for macroscopic examination and 2- to 5-µm-thick sections for microscopic examination [ 4 ] .
This method proves to be an effective tool for the study of tissue development , particularly in tissue regeneration research of bones and teeth .

Consequently , the total time required for antigen preparation and immunization exceeds three months .
On the other hand , when producing monoclonal antibodies in mice , the whole procedure consisting of immunization of inbred ( Balb / c ) mice by injecting the antigens intraperitoneally , fusion of splenic B lymphocytes with myeloma cells , and cloning of the hybridoma cell strain in culture takes at least six months .
Recently , Sado et al. introduced a novel way of producing monoclonal antibodies in rats called the “rat lymph node method” [ 5 , 9 , 10 ] .
This method is characterized by injection of antigens into the skin of footpads followed by collection of B cells from medial iliac lymph nodes in an inbred ( WKY ) rat strain .

Approximately 100 positive wells producing antibody of interest were identified using this method .
By comparison , approximately 10 positive wells were identified using the more conventional mouse spleen method after three immunization injections .
The relative proportions of hybridomas producing IgM , IgG1 , IgG2a , IgG2b , and IgG3 , following fusion using iliac lymph node lymphocytes obtained 14 days after injection were 14.0 % , 78.7 % , 3.2 % , 3.5 % and 0.5 % , respectively .
This method demonstrated the following advantages : ( 1 ) a single injection of the antigen emulsion was sufficient , ( 2 ) the lymph nodes were ready for use 14 days after injection , and ( 3 ) a high yield of positive hybridomas was obtained .

Previous research has demonstrated the experimental utility of two methods for delivering genes to the synovial lining of joints , ex vivo transfer using a retrovirus and in vivo delivery using an adenovirus ( Table 1 ) [ 2 , 3 , 4 ] .
The former approach has been used in a human clinical trial [ 5 ] , but is cumbersome and tedious , and selectively targets type B synoviocytes .

To reduce culture artifacts by conventional repeated passaging and long-term culture in vitro , the isolation of synovial fibroblasts ( SFB ) was attempted from rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) synovial membranes by trypsin / collagenase digest , short-term in vitro adherence ( 7 days ) , and negative isolation using magnetobead-coupled anti-CD14 monoclonal antibodies .
This method yielded highly enriched SFB ( 85 % prolyl-4-hydroxylase+ / 74 % Thy-1 / CD90+ cells ; < 2 % contaminating macrophages ; < 1 % leukocytes / endothelial cells ) that , in comparison with conventional fourth-passage RA-SFB , showed a markedly different phenotype and significantly lower proliferation rates upon stimulation with platelet-derived growth factor and IL-1β .

Another technique involved negative isolation directly from the trypsin / collagenase digest .
This approach proved technically prohibitive for the amount of different anti-leukocyte and anti-endothelial mAbs and Dynabeads® M-450 goat anti-mouse IgG necessary for complete removal of all contaminating cell types .
Positive isolation from primary culture with the anti-Thy-1 mAb AS02 and Dynabeads® M-450 goat anti-mouse IgG was also tested .
This method was unsuitable because : first , the percentages of contaminating macrophages were too high / variable ( 2-15 % ) ; second , the isolated SFB showed a significantly reduced surface density for Thy-1 ( MFI 19 versus 152 before isolation ; n = 4 , P ≤ 0.05 ) , presumably due to contact with the mAb used for isolation ; third , the magnetobeads remained attached to the positively isolated SFB for as long as 1 week , thus requiring further manipulation for their removal ( eg with anti-idiotypic mAbs ) ; fourth , a substantial proportion of SFB ( approximately 30 % ) was lost into the negative fraction ; and , finally , a Thy-1-dependent isolation technique bore the risk of selecting for SFB subpopulations , since the prolyl-4-hydroxylase+ cells obtained by negative isolation with Dynabeads® M-450 CD14 contained both a Thy-1+ fraction ( RA , 49.3± 14.9 % , n = 6 ; OA , 43.6 ± 12.0 % , n = 4 ) and a Thy-1- fraction , as demonstrated by double-staining FACS analysis .

This approach as been used to follow isotope-labeled materials in joints of arthritis patients .
It has the advantage that the individual components can be radiolabeled and followed in vivo , but has the disadvantage that γ-emitters of sufficiently high activity also have relatively short half-lives .
Cells can be labeled prior to transfer to animals or can be labeled in situ by injection of monoclonal antibodies labeled with appropriate isotopes [ 9 , 10 ] .
This method has lower resolution than PET , but is simpler and utilizes isotopes such as 111In that are readily incorporated into live cells .

Moreover , this graphical representation demonstrates that as patients respond to therapy , they tend to have expression profiles that are less like those of untreated patients with active disease and more like those of healthy controls ( Fig. 7 ) .
In fact , the distance a given group of treated patients moved towards the normal controls was proportional to their level of response , with fully responsive patients moving closer to healthy controls than partially responsive patients ( Fig. 7 ) .
In contrast , the position on the graph of the values obtained from a patient who was nonresponsive to standard therapy , whose disease severity actually increased after initiation of therapy ( values for four separate samples taken between 2 and 8 weeks after therapy are represented in Fig. 7 ) , changed in a manner that is distinct from those responding to therapy ( responders were positioned away from the active disease group towards the healthy controls in a clockwise manner , and the four values obtained from the nonresponsive patient were positioned away from the active disease group in a counterclockwise manner ) ( Fig. 7 ) .
This method of pharmacogenomic analysis therefore provides a means of developing a clinical assay that may predict patients ' response to therapy early in the course of polyarticular JRA treatment .

Some infiltrating cells as well as the cartilage surface stained positively for citrulline and the major sources of citrullinated proteins in the arthritic joint were extracellular deposits , presumably fibrin deposits .
The occurrence of citrullinated proteins in the joints is specific , because other investigated organs such as lung , ear , spinal cord , spleen , lymph nodes and salivary glands were all negative ( data not shown ) .
For comparison with previous studies in humans [ 43 ] and mice [ 13 ] we also used antibodies targeting chemically modified citrulline .
This method circumvents the risk of epitope blocking by residues flanking citrulline , because the citrulline side-chain becomes so bulky through the chemical modification that antibody recognition can not be influenced by other amino acids [ 5 , 41 ] .

MRL / lpr mice to which CCR2-Treg cells had been transferred showed significantly reduced progression of pneumonitis and sialadenitis in comparison with MRL / lpr mice that had received Treg cells .
This was due to more pronounced migration of CCR2-Treg cells and their localization for a longer time in MCP-1-expressing lung and submandibular gland , resulting in stronger suppressive activity .
We prepared chemokine receptor-expressing Treg cells and demonstrated their ability to ameliorate disease progression by accumulating in target organs .

With this choice , the Gabor filter is very similar to the derivative of a Gaussian used in the Canny algorithm , and it is therefore not surprising that this choice gives good results for step edges .
To select the angle θ , they suggested estimating the edge direction at each point of an image from the gradient of the smoothed image and then evaluate the convolution with a Gabor filter using the gradient direction for θ .
The edges were then marked as pixels of local maxima in filter response .

The models were benchmarked against the trypsin-like serine protease family and the globin family , and in both cases proved to have high specificity and sensitivity compared to the models in use at the time ( primarily , BLAST ) in remote homology detection .
One of the limitations of this model , however , was the reliance on threading methods requiring at least one determined structure to build a model .
Hedman et al. [ 16 ] included information about predicted transmembrane segments into the standard Smith-Waterman and profile-search algorithms for membrane proteins by adding an extra delta ( score ) when two residues that are both predicted to belong to transmembrane segments are aligned .
This method was found to improve the detection rate , mainly by increasing specificity ( ie. decreasing the number of false positives ) .

Total scores were calculated by summing the raw score obtained from the shifted dot product of the sequence profile vectors and the shifted dot product of the secondary structure probability vectors ( weighted by some factor ) .
This technique was derived from hybrid threading approaches and was found to be more sensitive than the sequence-only approach or sequence-to-structure threading approach .
Teodorescu et al. [ 18 ] proposed a linear combination of threading and sequence-alignment to produce a single ( mixed ) scoring table .
This method was found to be particularly sensitive in detecting sequences with less than 25 % of sequence identity , yet with similar structures .

We present an automatically generated unbiased method that provides a hierarchical classification of all currently known proteins .
The explosive growth in the number of sequenced proteins has created a glut of proteins that are sequenced but whose structure and function are as yet unknown .
A common way to tackle this problem is to use database searches to find proteins similar to a newly discovered protein , thus inferring protein function .
This method is generalized by protein clustering or classification where databases of proteins are organized into groups or families in a manner that attempts to capture protein similarity .

The main difference between the conventional MMM and its recent extensions are that the conventional MMM disregards the fact that the true distribution of z ( the statistical variable under study ) may be different from the null distribution of the statistics Z ( as defined below ) .
This assumption can potentially lead to invalid inference .
A modified version of the MMM ( Mod2MMM hereafter ) , introduced in [ 6 ] , assumes that the denominator and the numerator of one of t-statistic-type score zi may not be independent .

However , these labels tend to be relatively short ( e.g. " membrane fusion " or " regulation of viral life cycle " ) and often the terms in a given label occur in many other labels ( in particular terms such as " regulator / regulation " and " activity " ) throughout the GO .
As such , the occurrence of an individual term that is part of a GO node label in a document may not be a sufficiently reliable indicator of the relevance of that GO node to the document .
To address this , we utilized a method for expanding the set of terms associated with a given GO node .
This method is based on the idea that the presence of words that are strongly associated with a GO node label are good indicators of that GO node , in addition to the terms that occur in the node label itself .

The hybrid system combines the regular expression classifier with the vector-space classifier .
Unlike Larkey and Croft [ 13 ] we do not merge our classifiers by linear combination because the RegEx module does not return a scoring consistent with the vector space system .

In summary , starting with a single set of joint probabilities at one particular generating divergence time t* , we calculate the joint probabilities at any other arbitrary time , assuming an exponential model of evolution .
To that effect , given the particular set of joint probabilities ( 7 ) we have calculated the corresponding rate matrix ( 10 ) by Taylor expansion .
Thus we can estimate the substitution matrix / conditional probabilities at any other arbitrary time , simply using equation ( 2 ) , and reconstruct the joint probabilities at any other arbitrary time .
This method allows us to evolve pair emission probabilities corresponding to different processes ( in addition to the 4 × 4 nucleotide emissions ) for instance 20 × 20 amino acid-to-amino acid joint emission probabilities , 64 × 64 codon-to-codon joint emission probabilities , or 16 × 16 RNA basepair-to-basepair joint emission probabilities .

In the limit t = ∞ , the pairwise alignment of two finite-length sequences is going to be dominated by gap-to-gap alignments , which implies that as the divergence time increases the marginal probability of a residue becomes negligible , while the marginal probability of a gap becomes one in the limit t = ∞ .
Our evolutionary model has to be able to accommodate such saturation frequencies .
I will start by describing the steps to implement the method before explaining how to derive those steps .
This method can be applied starting from two different situations : starting from a N × N set of joint probabilities at a generating time that need to be extended to allow indel characters and evolved with time ; or starting from a given N × N rate matrix that needs to be extended to allow indel characters .

The Markov chain was used to generate new sequences by choosing a starting base at random according to the marginal probabilities of the bases in the first position , and by selecting at random a transition from each successive matrix at each step .
This procedure prevents transitions that never appear in the alignment from being generated , as could instead happen if the synthetic sites had been generated by sampling from the probability distribution described by the NWM , while at the same time preserving the " core " sequence ( the most conserved nucleotides ) that Match relies on .
Therefore , this method is well suited for generating sequences that can be recognized by both HMMER and Match , without giving an unfair disadvantage to any of the two methods .
This method was favored over inserting at random binding sites from the alignments used to generate the NWM or HMM in order to keep the training and test set separate and to evaluate the two methods based on their ability to detect sequences that are similar but not identical with the one already reported as it would be expected for novel bona fide binding sites .

In summary , we examined the applicability of using Zipf 's law as the basis for a novel normalization technique , which is applicable to both one channel microarray data and two channel microarrays .
This method is shown to out-perform such methods as global normalization to the mean but would appear to be inferior to quantile normalization .

For the Gavin dataset , when 57 edges were removed the total time to cluster was 1 h 25 min but when removing 1500 edges it took 10 h 10 min .
According to the software documentation [ 17 ] and as discussed by Newman [ 6 ] the running time for sparse graphs ( such as these ) is proportional to both the number of edges removed and the total number of nodes .
The Ito dataset ( see below ) took > > 24 h when > 500 edges were removed .
This method is therefore of greater utility for small to medium datasets , having less than 2000 nodes or edges .

We have shown that our method significantly improves the quality of data from two different BAC-array platforms and outperforms other normalization techniques on three data sets .
The proposed algorithm is particularly suitable for correcting spatial effects not related to array design ( row , column , or print-tip group effects ) : indeed , the arrays studied show two distinct types of such spatial effect ( local spatial bias and continuous spatial gradients ) , which can simultaneously affect any given array .
In such cases , using spatial trend correction after spatial segmentation helps to remove or reduce these two types of spatial effect , while preserving the true biological signal .
This method is original in the application of a segmentation algorithm for detecting and removing local spatial bias , preventing the misinterpretation of experimental artifacts as biologically relevant outliers in the genomic profile .

When the spatial trend is estimated from the log-ratios , we first apply a basic correction to these log-ratios to prevent confusion between spatial artifacts and biologically relevant effects .

The spatial trend is estimated from these centered log-ratios .
This method helps to decrease the impact of true genomic aberrations on the detection of spatial trends in the data , particularly for samples with many , or large genomic alterations , as most of these alterations correspond to the gain or loss of whole chromosome arms .

Analysis by hierarchical clustering or k-means is usually complicated in the presence of high-dimensional input data and noisy outliers , the latter also affecting the interpretation of SOM clustering results .
Statistical tests such as Fisher 's exact test , ANOVA based global test , or gene set enrichment analysis ( GSEA ) produce useful hypotheses about significant transcriptional regulation [ 17 ] , but they require that preconditions like certain data distributions are fulfilled and that test parameters are chosen carefully .
Here , the neural gas clustering method is used with Pearson correlation similarity measure for computing cluster centroids .
This method is known to yield consistent high-quality clusters , regardless of centroid initialization [ 15 ] .

The key idea behind our adaptive bin framework is to improve the effectiveness of a given search process , such as canonical Monte Carlo search , by making it adaptive and augmenting it with a mechanism for storing and retrieving promising conformations .
This is achieved by using a series of bins each of which holds a set of conformations within a certain energy range and an adaptive strategy for restarting a given search process with a conformation retrieved from these bins when the search stagnates .
By varying the search strategy according to a priori defined transition probabilities ( which are dependent on the search progress ) , this approach leads to an algorithm that sacrifices an exact relationship with the canonical ensemble for search efficiency .
This method effectively reduces the slow convergence , or quasi-ergodicity , in rugged energy landscapes ; it is therefore very useful when the main interest is in finding global minima , rather than in obtaining other physical properties from canonical ensembles .

The loess method fits the arrays to a polynomial surface , the scale-method scales the log-ratios to have the same median-absolute-deviation across arrays .
The other methods use quantile [ 32 ] to ensure that the intensities have the same empirical distribution across arrays and across channels or vsn [ 33 ] for a robust estimation of variance-stabilizing and calibrating transformations for microarray data .
Background correction can be performed via the normexp-method .
This method results in a smooth monotonic transformation of the background subtracted intensities such that all the corrected intensities are positive .

A curve is fitted to the fold changes within a small intensity window .
The values are then scaled such that the average fold change becomes zero within the window .
An alternative way to apply non-linear normalisation is to use quantiles [ 28 ] .
This method forces the intensity distributions on each chip to be identical by ranking the intensities , and resetting the intensity values at each rank across all chips to be the mean of the intensities at that rank .

We also find that proper normalization is closely related to the issue of whether mock control should be used : in the absence of proper normalization , mock control is generally necessary to eliminate the effect of systematic errors ; but through appropriate normalization , the lack of mock controls may be compensated .
We find that the use of the proposed normalization method alone without the use of mock control is sufficient to identify the binding events and that the correlation among biological replicates also improves as a result .
Furthermore , our normalization strategy also yields insight into the question of differential enrichment of histone occupancy in genic and intergenic regions [ 3 ] .
This methodological investigation is made possible by a unique data set we have generated on dosage compensation in Drosophila [ 12 ] .

A method that transforms the distributions of gene expressions of two data sets similarly was proposed [ 14 ] .
However , this method did not consider biological differences between the two different experimental groups , such as normal and tumor , because they used the average expression value of these two groups to define a reference sample .
A recent study introduced an ANOVA , Analysis of Variance , model to select discriminative genes from several datasets derived from different experimental environments [ 15 ] .
This method can be flexible to consider any clinical variables as well as genetic information including several effect factors , which represent experimental conditions .

This means that our method preserves original biology of two data sets .
In addition , we detected colorectal cancer related genes which might be dropped in separated data sets by using a combined data set .
By simulation study , we confirmed that the proposed method can detect more reliable information from a combined data and it is more effective in small data sets derived from different experimental conditions .
This method may not be appropriate when the different experimental features in data sets include biological variations ( for example , early disease stages of I and II in data set A and advanced disease stages of III and IV in data set B ) because the expression values of a specific experimental group are transformed into the form of the corresponding experimental group of a reference data set .

An initial combinatorial method was introduced by Clark [ 6 ] .
This algorithm first constructs a list of all haplotypes found from unambiguous individuals , i.e. individuals with at most one heterozygous site .
Then , for all the ambiguous individuals ( with more than one heterozygous site ) , it picks up a compatible haplotype from that list and adds the complementary haplotype to continue the process .
This method is a variation of the parsimonious approach which asserts that the smaller the haplotypes set is to solve all the individuals , the better the solution will be .

This statistical framework can handle a higher level of complexity in the data such as a larger number of SNPs , missing data , or multi-allelic sites .
One of the best-known approaches is the EM algorithm [ 12 ] which estimates haplotype frequencies by maximizing the likelihood of the sample genotype under the assumption of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium .
The most frequent haplotypes pairs can then be assigned for each genotype in the sample .
This method works well but has limitations linked to storage requirements because the number of possible haplotypes grows exponentially with the number of loci treated .

Such evidence is being cataloged in numerous databases as protein-protein interactions , genetic interactions , and coexpression patterns , which are rapidly expanding with the advent of large-scale , high-throughput assays .
But it remains a challenge to form meaningful networks from this data and grow our understanding of pathways .
To address this challenge , we created a new pathway resource , which incorporates additional genes into our existing set of pathways using prior evidence .
This method of pathway extension has been previously used to include new genes predicted to expand and enhance the content of existing pathways and gene sets [ 36 ] .

If there is a character that has an occurrence percentage greater than or equal to some preset value , p , the repeats are extended .
For example , if extending left , a p value of 100 % extends exact k-mer matches to exact ( k+1 ) -mer matches only if the character to the left of all repeats within the CRISPR is the same .
Thus , for p = 100 % , exact repeats are detected , while lower values allow for the detection of approximate repeats .
This method of extending repeats works well for CRISPRs , give an appropriate value for p ( CRT uses a default value of 75 % ) .

The study of multiple distinct mutations can be addressed by formal methods , such as statistical diversity analysis based on information theory .
Korber et al. [ 12 ] demonstrated the benefits of numerical variability measures by comparing the information entropy of separate alignments of HIV protein sequences , sampled from blood and brain tissues .
They identified sites which were highly conserved ( lower entropy ) in the brain but not in blood , suggesting that the virus had forgone mutations to adapt to brain tissues .
This method relies on entropy differentials between the two groups , and only sites characterised by high diversity in blood isolates were selected .

In practice , comparative studies often need to test multiple hypotheses that require diverse selection criteria ( for example , restricting selections to specific time periods , or geographical areas ) , demanding considerable additional effort in alignment construction .
To address this problem , we constructed an annotated dataset in which sequences are accompanied by descriptive metadata , including strain name , subtype , host , year and country of isolation , protein name .
We produced master alignments for each protein , so that subset alignments can be subsequently extracted through metadata queries , without further realignment .
This method allows rapid comparisons of sequence subsets using arbitrary selection criteria .

Some alignment errors may not be prevented by spectral considerations , however , for instance , errors that might occur when multiple isobaric compounds are retained differently during chromatography .
There is an additional requirement for peak matching that the match not adversely affect the alignment of too many of the remaining peaks in its block ( as set by the prof parameter ) .
The effect of the prof criterion is to delay the matching of potentially troublesome peaks such as isobaric compounds , ultimately until they exist alone in a block , at which time , the desireability of using them for alignment is evaluated by a loess-based smoothing criterion .
This method potentially can calibrate even heavily misaligned peaks since peaks are found in an adjustable search range ; we know of no other alignment algorithm for which the deviation in retention time from sample to sample can exceed the time between a peak and its neighbors [ 8 , 18 ] .

This would contribute to obtaining a robust dataset based on which we could assess specificity and significance of the alignment methods .

Note that one can not use all 31 predictor time points in this classical regression approach , since then the number of predictors would be larger than the sample size which is not possible .
This approach requires to fit as many such regressions as there are response time points , and therefore it requires a large number of parameters with the associated problems .
So while this approach is conceptually and numerically simple , it does not provide dimension reduction , does not take into account the continuity of the underlying trajectories , and is subject to measurement errors in the predictors .
This method is also not amenable to global significance analysis , as one encounters a multiple testing problem when dealing with the many separate regressions ( and their associated coefficients of determination ) .

Domain pairs with E-value above a certain threshold are predicted as interacting .
The idea that domain-domain interactions should be discovered as putative explanations of protein-protein interactions rather than predictors of these interactions was also the cornerstone of a recently proposed Parsimonious Explanation ( PE ) method [ 2 ] , which assumes that interactions between proteins evolved in a parsimonious way , and uses optimization to predict domain interactions .
Lee and colleagues [ 3 ] improved on a previous work [ 21 ] by creating what we refer to in this paper as the Integrated Bayesian ( IB ) method .
This method estimates the likelihood of domain interactions based on a protein interaction network from four different organisms ( prediction from each network is treated as independent evidence ) , and on the amount of biological evidence relating two domains , such as co-occurrence of domains in the same protein and existence of common GO terms at the functional level .

The combination of over-representation tests , that take into account the specific sequence of bases , and position uniformity tests , that consider the positional distribution of the motifs , has the potential to represent a more powerful technique for motif classification , than the ones currently used .
This methodology is easily adapted to other computational biology applications where position is thought to be biologically relevant and where the non-uniformity of observed motifs may provide strong indication of biological relevance ( e.g. , [ 10 ] ) .

Since the approximation to the Chi-square distribution described above is not accurate and might not be appropriate for small sample sizes , a bootstrap version of the Chi-square test was also implemented and analyzed .
Parametric bootstrap methodologies are adequate to deal with few observations [ 15 ] and goodness-of-fit tests can be easily adapted to this methodology .
In parametric bootstrap the objective is to infer a characteristic θ from a sample ( x1 , x2 , ... , xn ) taken from a population with known distribution F .
This method also applies to hypotheses tests : we have to establish the hypothesis H0 and H1 to test and then choose the appropriated statistic to discriminate between these hypotheses .

We find that binding models , using minimal sidechain repacking and ASA-based solvation terms , are quite different depending on whether they are fit to data for ΔG ( wild-type complexes ) or ΔΔG ( modelled mutant complexes differenced to wild-type complexes ) .
Whereas buried non-polar area dominates the ΔG model ( Figure 1 , Table 2 ) , consistent with previous work [ 17 ] , other interactions assume much greater importance for the mutant complexes ( Figure 2 , Table 2 ) , and the ΔG binding model does not reproduce the spread of ΔGEXP within mutant sets ( Figure 3 ) .
Investigating whether different sidechain repacking could alter this discrepancy , a scheme for packing sidechains towards protein structure has been derived from a mean-field framework ( Figure 4 ) .

In this work we have implemented two sub-optimal approaches with unique solution , being also known as wrappers [ 4 ] .

However , both of these methods are based on the assumption that the evolutionary process is time-reversible .
A method that can better recapture non-time-reversible substitution processes uses rooted triples of sequences where X and Y are the sister taxa , and Z is the outgroup [ 30 ] .
If X has the same base at that position as Z , the assumption is that the change most likely occurred between Y and its common ancestor with X .
This method thus leads to a directional and not necessarily time-reversible P^ , which can then be used to obtain Q^ ( see [ 31 ] for additional details , and for a comparison of directional and undirectional estimates of Q ) .

In principle , correctly built protein families are highly preferable to mere sorted lists of pairwise matches for performing phylogenetic profiling , but there may be no way to know in advance how to set the granularity of the protein clustering method correctly to solve a particular biological problem .
We describe below a simple but powerful heuristic for scanning the set of all proteins from a test genome against a phylogenetic profile by examining their respective ordered lists of best BLAST hits from other genomes .
An optimal cutoff is chosen separately for each hits list , at the point where the number of genomes encountered so far marked YES in the profile , vs the number marked NO , shows the greatest statistical significance according to the binomial distribution .

DNA fragments used for recombination were linear PCR products which consisted of the foreign insertion sequence flanked by homologous sequences of the target gene .
Described herein is the insertion of a section of the M2e epitope ( LM2 ) of Influenza A virus , a domain of CD154 ( CD154s ) or a combination of both into the outer membrane protein LamB of S. enteritidis .
We have successfully used this method to produce multiple mutants with no antibiotic gene on the genome or extra sequence except those nucleotides required for expression of epitope regions .
This method is advantageous over other protocols in that it does not require cloning or creating extra duplicate regions to facilitate homologous recombination , contains a universal construct in which an epitope of choice can be placed to check for cell surface expression , and shows high efficiency when screening for positive mutants .

However , treatment with sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin at concentrations up to 0.25 mg / ml showed a limited effect on the viral infectivity .
This suggests that the surfaces of AAV2 particles may be biotinylated by using sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin in this concentration range with minimal effect on the viral infectivity .
To test if the viral surfaces were indeed biotinylated , particularly when the concentration of sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin was relatively low , excess avidin was added to AAV2 after biotinylation reaction , and the viral infectivity was then analyzed on HeLa cells .
This method allows the assessment of the presence of biotin groups on the viral surfaces , since the viral infectivity is significantly reduced by the binding of avidin to viral-surface biotin groups , as shown previously for biotinylated Ad5 particles [ 26 ] .

However , under the right conditions , axon extensions can regenerate over small gaps caused by injury , reconnecting with the distal stump and eventually reestablishing its function .
In the case of small injuries , current treatments for severed nerves typically rely on microsuture of the nerve stumps .
If substantial loss of nervous tissue occurs , clinical treatment involves donor nerves obtained from a second operative site of the patient , such as an autologous nerve graft , vein graft , or arterial graft .
This method is far from being the gold standard though , because its benefits have to be counterbalanced by function loss at the donor sites , formation of potential painful neuromas , structural differences between donor and recipient grafts preventing a successful regeneration , and shortage of graft material for extensive repair [ 1 , 2 ] .

The unit of analysis for the array data was a sample from a single cell line with parallel preparations for all samples and a sample size of eight .
Since the purpose of this study is partially hypothesis formation ( as opposed to strict hypothesis testing ) , we elected a priori to examine the 100 most extreme median log ratios ( over the eight cell culture arrays ) for large differences between the treatments as well as biological patterns that could lead to more explicit hypothesis testing in future experiments using primary xenograft tumors .
The median was chosen as the summary measure of expression across the eight arrays ( for each oligonucleotide ) because the median has been shown to have better performance than mean-based statistics , such as the t-statistic or the SAM statistic , in identifying spiked-in RNAs using small sample sizes [ 22 ] .
This method of analysis is also similar to that suggested by Breitling et al.

The algorithm detects the first four milliseconds of the filtered signal which becomes a constant voltage ( isoelectric ) and then this four seconds of baseline plus any ensuing baseline up to the next P wave , are best least squares fit to the same duration of filtered inverted image baseline .
The Novel algorithm is based on the axiomatic principle that the T wave end point is that first point of intersection ( overlap ) of the T wave with a superimposed inverted image of itself i.e. when both the T wave and its inverted image first coincide and return to a common baseline ( the isoelectric line ) .
This occurs when there is best least squares fit between both the T wave and its inverted image along the isoelectric line within the TP segment .
This method is equivalent to using the T wave as a template which measures itself .

With the exception of the Novel method , the other five automatic algorithms demonstrated very poor accuracy .
The Novel algorithm displayed a superior accuracy compared to the other measurement algorithms because the method uses the template of the T wave to in effect measure its own offset .
It uses an inverted image of itself as a template to determine the first time at which the upright T wave and its inverted image return together to a common isoelectric baseline .
This method therefore is the common measure of the physiological end for both the inverted and upright T waves , rather than using a surrogate marker for the end of the T wave as seen in the other algorithm methods .

In the implementation in PKQuest , a number of alternative options are allowed for choosing or inputting the break points .
Since this method is a generalized parametric approach , one would like to use the smallest number of breakpoints ( and , therefore , the fewest adjustable parameters ) that are compatible with the input function .
A new feature that is introduced here is the use of the gamma distribution input approximation to automatically select the breakpoints ( this is the default option in PKQuest ) .
This method first chooses the breakpoints that provide a good fit to the gamma distribution , and then supplements these breakpoints with additional points ( at 1 hour intervals ) at long times when the gamma distribution is small .

Specific adverse reactions to CAMs observed were over-sedation or hyperactivity in epileptic patients ( 2 ) , frequent exacerbation of difficulty in breathing in the asthmatic patients ( 3 ) , and fever , diarrhoea and vomiting in the sickle cell anaemic patients ( 2 ) .
Most studies evaluating CAM use for children have used self-administered questionnaires , which have significant limitations such as the use of terms and concepts that are confusing to parents / caregivers , and poorer response rates from incomplete filling of the questionnaire [ 13 , 43-49 ] .
These limitations were addressed in the present study by the researchers or the research assistants conducting the interviews , providing samples of the biological CAM products and photographs of the different alternative medical practices available in Lagos , and explaining each of the terminologies used in the questionnaire to the parents .

This difference in water potential is assumed to have a value that is dependent upon the volume of the guard cell ( one of the state variables ) and will vary with time as the guard cell volume varies .
One other assumption in the model is that there is some volume of guard cell at which this potential difference between guard cell and subsidiary cell would be zero due to increasing guard cell turgor ( which increases with guard cell volume as solutes accumulate in the guard cell ) .
This value of cell volume is defined as a fraction of the maximum guard cell size for a totally unstressed plant .

Moreover , as the strength of NGG media is determined by the concentration of divalent cations , low concentrations of the nontoxic chelating agent ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) break the bonds responsible for the gel matrix , yielding a liquid suspension that easily passes through sieves with a mesh size down to 10 μm .
This method permits the liquefaction of whole culture plates such that the nematodes can be readily extracted in virtually infinite numbers from cultures without adhering residues of culture medium [ 24 ] .

Given that patients with toxic , ingestions , uremia , and those with ketoacidosis were excluded and that lactate and serum albumin are accounted for in the ALCAG equation , the amount of unmeasured anions in this cohort of critically ill patients is elevated .
In order to better quantify these anions , the Fencl-Stewart methodology for acid-base assessment would be preferable .
[ 20 ] In this approach , the unmeasured anions can be assessed because the strong ion difference ( apparent and effective ) is directly measured .
This methodology involves the cotemporaneous measurement of the serum sodium , potassium , magnesium , chloride , lactate , pH , phosphorus , pCO2 , and serum albumin .

Recent methodological advances in molecular dating have aimed at relaxing the assumption of the global molecular clock [ 30 ] by modelling the variation of the evolutionary rate along the phylogenetic tree [ 31-35 ] .
Among these newly developed methods , the Bayesian relaxed molecular clock approach of Thorne et al. [ 32 ] appears particularly promising .
Indeed , it allows the calculation of divergence time estimates in the presence of rate variation among lineages coupled with the possibility of incorporating multiple paleontological constraints used as priors [ 36 ] .

Individual size is therefore represented by four scalars , one for each side and session .
The shape of an original configuration of landmarks is the geometrical information that is invariant to uniform scaling ( variation in size ) , translation ( differences in position ) , and rotation ( differences in orientation ) .
In contrast to size , shape is an inherently multidimensional space and we used Procrustes superimposition to characterize shape variation .
This method allows comparing configurations of landmarks by optimally superimposing ( according to a least-squares criterion ) homologous landmarks in two or more specimens to achieve an overall best fit [ 65 ].Because the data set included both left and right wings ( i.e. , we are dealing with " matching symmetry " [ 66 , 67 ] ) our analyses also removed differences due to reflection by changing the sign of the x coordinate of every landmark for configurations from the right side .

In this manner , we generate from each triplet an estimate of the rate of nucleotide substitution between the most recently diverged subtypes , and consequently provide an estimate of the TMRCA .
This circumvents the problems posed by earlier methods by directly estimating the pairwise rate of nucleotide substitution over the set of pairs of sequences straddling the subtype divergence without any further rate assumptions other than the existence of a mean .
However , this method is only capable of determining the rate between two subtypes where a third , more distantly related , subtype functions as an outgroup .
This method thus trades the ad hoc rate assumptions of the previous methods with two implicit conditions : ( i ) that subtypes have a unique divergence and ( ii ) a third , comparable subtype is available to serve as an outgroup .

In order to achieve this we considered a fixed crown node age of the monocots of 134 Mya , an estimate obtained by Bremer [ 79 ] .
This age is consistent with results obtained by other studies [ 83-85 ] .
We used the ' fossil cross-validation ' method to measure the agreement between these different calibration points [ 17 ] .
This method compares the difference between the fossil and molecular ages by rerunning the PL analysis with single calibration nodes .

To apply it to more than two sequences , Rodriguez-Ezpeleta et al. [ 32 ] computed all pairwise Bowker 's tests in their alignment and computed the median value ; one could also have counted the number of Bowker 's tests that are significant at a 5 % threshold according to a χ2 table .
However , none of these tests permit to estimate if the amount of heterogeneity that they detect in a given data set is sufficient to bias inferences made using homogeneous models , although this is likely the question an average user would like to answer .
Here , we describe a method to reveal the ability of evolutionary models to account for the compositional heterogeneity in a sequence alignment , which we measure using the median of all Bowker 's pairwise statistics , or the number of significant Bowker 's pairwise tests ( in the following , we note the measure of compositional heterogeneity h ) .
This method is tree-based , and uses parametric bootstrapping [ 10-12 ] .

Predicting functionally important residues with these methods provides a specific region of amino acids and potential domain boundaries that should be tested when searching for functional domains in vitro .
When a functional region has been identified in one gene family member , but the majority of the amino acids making up the functional region are aligned with gaps and/or are experiencing neutral changes , the region is likely not functioning in the same manner in the other sequences analyzed .
Examples include conserved domains IV and V in the FoxA cluster and the transactivation domain in the FoxI cluster ( Figure 2A , C , see Additional file 3 ( A , C ) ) .
This method identifies a region of amino acids that are less likely to be important for a specific function , which may then be examined last for functional significance when using in vitro methods .

Elimination of some noise in the data leads to better discrimination between the different topologies .
Our conclusion is that identification and removal of fast-evolving positions has been shown to be useful in revealing some phylogenetic information previously concealed by homoplasy [ 34 ] .
Moreover , elimination of a small number of sites ( 12-18 % for our three datasets ) , particularly for introns and concatenation of markers , allows for increase in the support for deeper nodes .
This method can effectively be useful because the deepest phylogenetic relationships , characterized by short internal branches , are very often the most difficult to resolve .

This normalization , as described in [ 21 ] , attempts to reduce the minimizing effect of higher sequence conservation on mutual information .
For example , if two pairs of columns have perfectly correlated substitutions , but one pair is more highly conserved than the other , the more highly conserved pair will have a lower MI .
Normalizing by joint entropy combats this : the pairs will have equal NMI .
This method was reimplemented based on the description in [ 21 ] .

We assessed the possibility of long-branch attraction artefacts in our analyses with a series of exploratory analyses ( there are no conclusive tests per se ) .
Firstly , we performed a distance-based relative rate test with RRTree [ 43 ] on the 18S rRNA data to test whether taxa differed significantly in their relative substitution rates .
We compared the results considering each taxon as a separate lineage , and using a pre-defined guide tree to allow rates to be compared between different supra-specific clades ( using the 18S rRNA topology of Meland & Willassen 2007 [ 6 ] ) .
This method has been used to identify fast-clock organisms for exclusion from phylogenetic analyses [ 44 , 45 ] .

The SQL query uses the property that each node inherits its parent path , therefore all children of a node can be selected based on its path being a prefix of the path of its parent .
This query uses an additional function GET-ID which returns name-id for a given name , simplifying the query so that it does not require any table joins .
Finally , columns name-id and parent-name-id in the table NODE are used by the ' Connect By ' clause ( see Additional file 1 , Query 3 ) .

This methodology extends readily to scenarios in which the parental genotypes are not known , using the approach of Rabinowitz and Laird [ 9 ] .

This may affect the false positive rate ( type I error ) for the association test , compared to case-control design based on independent samples .
Hence , any test of genetic association must account for the correlations among family members .
Slager and Schaid [ 7 ] extended the original CA trend test to case-control studies with family data , in which they modeled the correlations among related cases or controls as functions of the probability of their marker alleles shared identically by descent ( IBD ) .
This method can be applied to complex family structures and it obtains different correlations for different types of relative pairs .

Allelic and genotypic frequencies differences between cases and controls were assessed by χ2 .
A region-wide empirical p-value was calculated through permutation .

For the haplotype analysis , identification of the minimal set of SNPs that could account for the genotypic diversity was made by systematic enumeration in each block .
Haplotypes frequencies were calculated and , after skipping the haplotypes with a frequency lower than 0.02 , each SNP and set of SNPs in turn were removed .
Thus we found the SNP combination that preserves the marginal haplotype frequencies .
This method is implemented in the STRATEGY software .

Large deletions in the homozygous state are usually lethal to the developing C. elegans embryo .
Thus , from a plate of worms heterozygous for the deletion , one can pick individual dead eggs that have been laid , assuming that these must be homozygous for the deletion .
One can then use PCR to test whether a particular region of interest is present in such samples , thereby determining the extent of the deletion .
This method , which relies on a negative result ( i.e. , lack of a PCR product ) , has several drawbacks : ( a ) The amount of starting material is restricted to a single , or few dead eggs .

The first method is based on maximum parsimony : it searches for a set of minimum number of haplotypes that explain the observed genotype samples .
Clark 's method , the first developed algorithm for haplotype reconstruction [ 43 ] which can be viewed as a sort of parsimony approach , requires homozygote or single-site heterozygote in the sample to start its inferential cascade .

As a result , the LBM performed better in EAs than AAs , as might be expected given the dependence of LBMs on prior knowledge of allele frequencies .
Performance was not dependent on sample size .
The performance of the LBM depends on the efficiency and number of markers , and depends greatly on how representative the available reference allele frequencies are for those of the population being assigned .
This method is of value when the parental population is known and relevant allele frequencies are available .

The 23 sequences were clustered into six groups , which correspond to six different N-terminal sequences of LMW-m and LMW-s type genes ( Fig. 2 ) .
Sequence alignment showed that the sequences from different BAC clones in the same groups were identical in the aligned regions , suggesting that these BAC clones may contain identical LMW-GS genes .
After we obtained partial sequences of the coding regions of LMW-GS genes from individual BAC clones using the universal primers , we first tried to perform primer walking using BAC DNA as template and specific primers close to the end the known sequence obtained .
This method worked well for BAC clones containing single LMW-GS gene in many cases , but not for BAC clones containing two or more LMW-GS genes ( data not shown ) .

Then we tried to use TAIL PCR for the BAC clones containing two or more LMW-GS genes by designing three specific primers based on the known sequences obtained and one degenerated primer as described in Liu and Huang [ 9 ] .
In many cases , either more than two PCR products were amplified or no amplicons were generated ( data not shown ) .
Thirdly , we designed primers based on 5 ' and 3 ' terminal sequences of the known LMW-GS gene sequence [ GenBank : X13306 ] [ 19 ] combined with the above mentioned specific primers in order to generate PCR fragments from these BAC clones by primer-template mismatches .

All pairs of 396,591 autosomal markers were assessed for initial evidence of allelic association except for those within 1,000 markers of each other .
Since this required carrying out in the order or 7.8*1010 analyses , a rapid screening procedure was used to identify pairs which might potentially be of interest .
This consisted of selecting pairs for which the observed number of subjects having one of the four joint homozygote genotypes ( AA-AA , AA-BB , BB-AA or BB-BB ) differed from that which would be expected from the separate genotype frequencies by a particular threshold value of z based on a binomial expectation , where z = ( O-E ) / √E with O being the observed count and E the expected count .

No interaction terms of independent variables were included in this analysis .

In our study sample , 31 individuals out of the 616 with blood pressure measurements self-reported anti-hypertension medication use , only 5 % of the sample .
We accounted for anti-hypertensive medication use in these analyses using two different approaches .
First , we removed those on medication from the analysis ( annotated bp-med ) .
This method of accounting for medication was used in the previous study of blood pressure in this population [ 13 ] and was chosen because anecdotal evidence suggest that compliance to prescription guidelines are not rigid in the OOA community and members tend not to control their blood pressure tightly with medication .


./BMC_Genet/BMC_Genet-8-_-2071912.nxml.sentences
Therefore true underlying blood pressure levels would be difficult to predict .
The second method used to account for medication was to add a constant to the blood pressure measurements of those prescribed medication ( annotated bpAdj ) .

A few authors have shown by simulation that the impact of genotyping error on evidence for linkage could be particularly severe in affected sib-pair ( ASP ) designs [ 4-6 ] , virtually masking most of the evidence for linkage .
The impact of error on quantitative traits appears to be less dramatic in random samples , however it is unclear whether the same dramatic power losses hold in selected samples .
A method of choice is now emerging for the analysis of quantitative traits arising from selected sib pairs .
This method is essentially a regression through the origin of excess identical by descent ( IBD ) sharing on a function of the trait value , whose slope is an estimate of the linkage parameter .

One approach is to consider these correlated SNPs and systematically prioritize them according to known genomic and biological information such as locations of genes and cross-species conserved regions [ 20 ] .
Here we have implemented a complementary method to prioritize SNPs that capitalizes on differences in LD patterns between different world population groups .
We first identify the SNPs in strong LD with an associated SNP as measured by the correlation coefficient r2 in the initial population ; when r2 is reduced in a second population , we then have the opportunity to refine the association and filter out some of the originally correlated variants .
This method presumes that the mechanism of action for functional genetic variants is shared in common across human populations , although differences in allele frequencies at risk loci can lead to differences in prevalence .

Sometimes forensic samples may contain only small amounts of genomic DNA ( less than 100 pg ) , referred to as LCN DNA ( low copy number DNA ) , and/or may also be degraded into fragments smaller than 100 bp , resulting in failure of amplification of the STR loci and an incomplete DNA profile with lower discriminatory power [ 5 ] .

BASE was the method used in this study to infer the relationship between TFs and the survival probability of patients with different cancer types .
This method makes use of gene expression data and TF-gene binding affinities .
The intuition behind this method is that if a TF is related to the survival outcome of a patient given a certain disease , then the genes that are regulated by this TF will be more differentially expressed between the patients that survive or die .
This method is substantially different from finding a correlation , such as Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficients , between gene expression and binding affinity .

Numerous reports of expression data annotation have been previously described , in order to assess the large data sets that are considered to be the fruition of high-throughput methodologies .
Annotation is necessary because typical methods used to filter the data to a manageable load , such as clustering , can further complicate the dataset , as opposed to converge the output .
The Gene Ontology Consortium is a collection of databases for a variety of organisms , which is commonly used to annotate gene expression based on existing knowledge of biological function and a limited functionally-derived vocabulary .
This method is organised in a hierarchy of key words including molecular function , biological process , and cellular component [ 42 ] .

Prior to the concatemerization step , linker DNA , which are used to PCR amplify the ditags , need to be effectively removed as they tend to " poison " the concatemerization reaction by capping the ditags .
The standard procedure for removal of linker DNA involves the prior labeling of linkers with biotin , which in turn enables them to be removed later using streptavidin affinity capture .
For this , the commonly followed SAGE protocol [ 3 ] uses streptavidin coupled magnetic beads to capture and retain the linker against a magnetic field while the ditags are separated out .
This method is not only costly , due to the large amounts of magnetic beads needed , but also time consuming , as multiple wash and recovery cycles are required [ 3 ] .

Eight of the B. cereus / B. thuringiensis isolates were found to be very closely related to all B. anthracis isolates and formed a distinct cluster .
In the present study , B. cereus and B. thuringiensis isolates that vary in AFLP-based genomic relatedness to B. anthracis were examined for the presence of DNA sequence similar to pXO2 , to determine whether portions of this plasmid are conserved in closely related Bacillus isolates , and to determine whether the conservation of pXO2 sequences correlated with genomic relatedness established by AFLP comparisons [ 17 , 18 ] .
PCR was performed using template DNA from 11 Bacillus isolates that vary in relatedness to B. anthracis with primer sets designed to amplify DNA fragments from 47 different pXO2 ORFs .
This method was chosen to detect sequences with potential similarity to pXO2 because it is rapid and the reaction products can be readily sequenced .

Ultimately , in order to make a complete catalog of human genes , it will be necessary to gather undiscovered evidence from experiments and discard spurious evidence .
Our strategy for finding novel genes is to perform cDNA analysis using an organism closely related to humans , the cynomolgus monkey ( Macaca fascicularis ) .
In previous studies , we accumulated a number of 5'-end sequences of many clones derived from the oligo-capped cDNA libraries of the brain with high mRNA complexity , and determined approximately 1,500 full insert sequences of the clones whose 5'-end sequences showed no significant similarity to sequences in the public databases [ 5 , 6 ] .

Nevertheless ; there are some limitations to such studies on living flies .
Firstly , adult flies are mainly composed of post mitotic cells ; thus data obtained with flies may be relevant for comparison with the stress response of post mitotic tissues in other organisms ( for instance mammals ' neurons ) but could be less useful to address the question of stress response in dividing cells .
Secondly , limitations also arise from ROS-generating compounds delivery which in Drosophila is usually performed through food ingestion .
This method severely limits kinetic studies of acute stress responses on flies , since , within a few hours , large fluctuations in the quantity of ingested food are observed in batches of flies transferred to a new medium .

In summary , in this work we present a genome-wide method for the identification of sequences that replicate early in the S phase .
This method relied on the isolation and cloning of early replicating sequences followed by the end-sequencing and mapping of these clones to the nearly complete human genome sequence .
This allowed us to evaluate regions with overlapping clones that are similar in size to an average replicon and therefore should replicate at the same time in S phase .
This method has the advantage over microarray studies of replication timing in that there should be less contamination from adjacent sequences when trying to identify genomic features that correlate with time of replication .

Bound mRNA is then obtained by co-immunoprecipitation with the FLAG-PAB-1 protein [ 10 ] .
This method has been utilized to profile tissues and cell types in C. elegans and in Drosophila [ 8 , 10-14 ] .

To evaluate differences in gene expression a relative quantification method was chosen where the expression of the target gene is standardized by a non-regulated reference gene ; consequently , three replicates of each sample and endogenous control were amplified .

Another problem is that there is no method to statistically quantify the proportion of false positives in the set of TTGs .
To address these issues , we developed a new method to identify TTGs , which reduces the proportion of false positives by applying the False Discovery Rate ( FDR ) criterion to individual groups of genes that differ in the direction , magnitude , and time of response to the manipulation of a TF .
The computational strategy included optimization of Scores of Potential Function ( SPF ) of binding sites that separated best the training and control sets of genes , and estimation of the FDR from the frequency distribution of SPF among control genes ( Fig. 1 ) .

TTGs were selected using FDR = 0.2 as a threshold .
Because each group has a large number of genes ( median = 160 ) , FDR in each group can be interpreted as the proportion of false positives among genes that are assumed significant in this group .

To date investigations of PPase function in budding yeast have utilized mutations outside the catalytic site [ 5 , 14-16 ] or probed genetic interactions using single or double knockout PPase mutations [ 6 ] .
These approaches present constraints for large-scale analysis of PPase function since : ( 1 ) mutations outside the catalytic domain generally affect the formation of a specific class of holoenzyme or the ability to interact with co-factor ( s ) required for the proper targeting of the PPase to a subset of substrates [ 17-19 ] , and ( 2 ) the use of knockout alleles , in addition to precluding the analysis of the essential PPases , may lead to promiscuous and/or low-affinity interaction of regulatory subunits with PPases of the same class .

Different non-experimental approaches exist , the most widely used being the localization of GC skew in the sequence [ 19 ] .
We found that high throughput sequencing data can be used for this purpose , as recently discussed for ligation sequencing [ 20 ] .
In particular , the Solexa data generated from an exponentially growing culture presents a distribution bias , with more sequences near the replication origin and fewer near the terminus ( Fig 5B ) .
This method may be generalized to other organisms , since we easily reproduce the same pattern with another genome [ 21 ] ( Fig 5A ) .

To potentially increase power and account for non-linearity in dose-response relationships , the SAM analyses were supplemented by penalized isotonic regression ( PIR ) according to the method of Hu et al. ( 2005 ) [ 35 ] which was specifically designed for microarray analysis .
Similar to SAM , PIR penalizes lowly expressed genes and provides a permutation-based estimate of the false discovery rate .
In contrast to SAM , PIR allows for the dose-response relationship to be nonlinear , but assumes the relationship is increasing or decreasing as a function of increasing dose , and not the reverse direction .
This method results in a score ( the Mi-statistic ) for each probe set that quantifies the evidence for an increasing or decreasing dose-response relationship .

To overcome these drawbacks , other techniques have been developed that work directly with nuclear DNA .
The most generic is high-CoT sequencing ( HC ) , in which sheared DNA is separated based on renaturation time .
Repetitive fragments renature faster , allowing them to be removed .
This method has been applied in maize and resulted in 6-fold enrichment of genic sequences [ 8 , 9 ] .

To obtain p-values , observed values of WKS were compared with randomly sampled WKS statistics based on the product of randomly sampled weights , from a uniform distribution within the empirical range of calculated weights for all genes , and randomly sampled KS statistics , sampled from the theoretical distribution of the KS statistic .
Another score is based on the coefficient of variation ( CV ) , a statistic that measures large variations and is defined as the standard deviation divided by the mean .
For exon-level score , we calculated the CV of the residual products across tissues , CVtissue i ( pi , j , k ) and for the gene-level score , we calculated the standard deviation across exons within the gene , sdexon j [ CVtissue i ( pi , j , k ) ] .
This method is closest to the Rosetta approach [ 6 ] which relies on a statistic similar to the coefficient of variation .

This information was then used in the next steps of the process .
A more detailed investigation of the gene content was carried out using a combination of ab initio ( gene predictor programs ) and comparative gene prediction ( BLAST-EST sequence alignment ) .
For ab initio gene prediction , we first applied the methodology described for the AUGUSTUS gene predictor [ 40 ] .
This methodology essentially trains the AUGUSTUS program using a combination of sequences from the species of interest together with sequences of a phylogenetically related species , specifically with similarities in intron and exon length distributions .

The GC content is an excellent indicator of isochores in heterogeneous genomes as mammals .
The segmentation we obtained were well correlated with GC content and other properties associated to GC content such as gene density , the number of exons per gene and the length of introns .
Therefore , the GC content is the main property that allows the detection of isochore but more biological properties have to be taken into account .
This method allows detecting isochores in homogeneous genomes .

These scores are derived from four MDS variables - two cognitive items ( short-term memory and decision-making ) , one communication item ( ability to make self understood ) and one ADL item ( eating ) .
The CPS measure of cognitive impairment correlates highly with well accepted and frequently used research rating scale scores , including Folstein 's Mini-Mental Status Examination ( MMSE ) [ 19 , 24-26 ] .
This study examined the patterns of change in ADL for those residents with moderate to severe cognitive impairment therefore the CPS was used to identify residents in two groups : those with a CPS score of 3 ( mean MMSE 15 ) and classified as moderate impairment ( n = 7001 ) and those with a CPS score of 4 or 5 ( mean MMSE 5-6 ) and classified as severe impairment ( n = 4616 ) .

The COACH system presented above had three significant changes from the previous versions : 1 ) The use of markerless flocking to track the activity ; 2 ) the use of a partially observable Markov decision process ( POMDP ) to model the handwashing guidance problem ; and 3 ) the refinement of audio prompts and the addition of video demonstrations .
Tracking was accomplished using a computer vision technique known as flocking , which was developed by Hoey et al. [ 23 ] .
It uses models of skin and towel color combined with a Bayesian sequential estimation technique .
This method of tracking is quite robust and able to dependably track the location of the user 's hands and the position of the towel , even after occlusion by an object or after leaving and returning to the camera 's field of view .

Patients were recruited to a study investigating the use of New Zealand practice guidelines for the management of high blood pressure .
These practice guidelines specifically quantify the absolute risk of a cardiovascular event ( newly diagnosed angina , myocardial infarction , coronary heart disease , stroke or transient ischaemic attack ) over a five year period and are based on a Framingham risk equation [ 8 ] .
The guidelines are formatted in such a way that when an individual 's age , sex , smoking status , presence or absence of diabetes , total : HDL cholesterol ratio and blood pressure level are elicited their absolute risk of a cardiovascular event can be read directly from a coloured chart ( see : ) .
This method of risk assessment has been proposed as a rational way on which to base treatment recommendations for patients with high blood pressure [ 9 ] .

The higher reliability is a result of the reviewers collectively being able to distinguish more differences in the quality of care between patients ( p < 0.007 ) and not due to less random noise or individual reviewer bias in the measurement .
For these conditions the level of true quality ( i.e. the rating of quality of care that would result from the full population of physician reviewers reviewing a record ) varied from poor to good across patients .
For conditions with a well-developed quality of care evidence base , such as hypertension and diabetes , a single structured implicit review to assess the quality of care over a period of time is moderately reliable .
This method could be a reasonable complement or alternative to explicit indicator approaches for assessing and comparing quality of care .

Combining the information from the survey with that from the screening registry we observed that : 1 ) the non respondent population is very different from the respondent population regarding their utilisation of screening ; 2 ) the unadjusted results of the survey overestimate Pap-test coverage .
For the sensitivity analysis we used three different hypotheses .
For the intermediate hypothesis , we adjusted for screening compliance assuming that the non respondent women compliant to screening have the same coverage as the respondents compliant to screening , and that the non-respondent women non-compliant to screening have the same coverage as the respondent non-compliant to screening .
This method gives results similar to those from other surveys interviewing only non compliant women , proposed by several authors that was used to estimate the Pap-test coverage in areas where screening programs are active and have a registry available [ 35 , 36 ] .

Standardisation is frequently used in medical research to allow for the influence of differences in case mix ( such as different age or sex distributions ) when comparing populations or sub-groups ( such as different regions or hospitals ) .
The indirect arithmetic method is the most commonly used standardisation method in the literature .
It compares the actual number of events in a local area ( e.g. Birmingham ) with the number expected when factor-specific event rates ( e.g. age , sex ) in a reference population ( e.g. England ) are applied to the local population .
This method is often used to look at differences in mortality rates by means of standardised mortality ratios ( SMRs ) [ 1 , 2 ] .

To calculate rates for subclinical hyperthyroidism standardised by age and gender by the direct method , ages were categorised into four 5-year age bands ( 65-69 , 70-74 , 75-79 , 80 and over ) .
where i = 1 to 4 age groups and j = 1 , 2 sexes , Nij is the standard population size in age group i , sex j , ∑ijNij=N , pij is the age-sex specific rate in the study , p^ij is the estimated age-sex specific rate in the study , nij is the age-sex specific population in the study .
where Nagesex is the population with a specific age and sex ∑agesexNagesex=N .
This method of calculating the confidence interval for the standardised logit and then back transforming to obtain standardised rates is used since the distribution of the logit is liable to be closer to the Normal distribution since the scale ranges from ( -∞ to +∞ ) as opposed to between ( 0 and 1 ) .

So as to select an optimal model , different hypotheses about the most closely fitting underlying distribution ( exponential , Weibull , log-logistic , gamma , and Gompertz ) were evaluated using Wald tests if models were nested ( for example , the exponential distribution is a particular case of the Weibull ) , or the Akaike Information Criterion if they were not .
Ordinarily , survival analysis assumes that events occur when they are observed ( right-censoring ) .

The imputation of gender of contacts was performed based on the same reasoning .
For the imputation of contact characteristics like duration and usual frequency , we considered it unlikely that a single professional contact in a large set of such contacts would last longer than 4 hours and reoccur daily .
Therefore , we imputed these two variables jointly by sampling from the bivariate distribution of duration and frequency for work contacts of participants for whom 10 < niw ≤ 20 .
This method could also be more widely applied to all characteristics in an attempt to avoid disrupting dependencies , but could just the same also enforce dependencies .

This is a transmission disequilibrium test ( TDT ) type approach for assessing association between DNA variant alleles and disease phenotype under the standard genetic models ( dominant , recessive and additive ) .
Unlike the classic TDT , which was designed for specific pedigree structures ( ie. parent-child triads ) , the FBAT can appropriately utilise data from multiple nuclear families derived from a single multiplex pedigree to test for association [ 29 ] .
We also utilised a powerful statistical test developed by Slager and Schaid ( 2001 ) [ 30 ] , which involves comparing genotype frequencies of genetically related cases ( sampled from multiplex affected families ) with the unrelated control group frequencies .
This method is based on the Armitage test for trend and includes a variance estimate that appropriately accounts for the non-independence of related cases .

Although conventional MDS can reconstruct the underlying map showing the relations between a number of objects , the map itself is arbitrary to rotation .
Turning the map through any angle does not change any of the distances between pairs of objects , and therefore the axes of the map can not be known - in the case of a geographical map , there is no indication of the north-south and east-west axes .
The problem of the arbitrariness of dimensions can be circumvented by means of a variant of MDS known as INDSCAL ( Individual Differences Scaling ) [ 44 , 45 ] .
This method analyses the similarity matrices either of individual subjects or of groups of subjects who are likely to differ , so that , for instance , one might have groups based on sex and age , the presumption being that older students may have different career preferences from their younger peers , and female students may have different preferences from their male peers .

To test condition 3 we fit a logistic regression model with both relationship style and the specialty choice factors that met condition 2 , with the outcome being a match in a non-primary care ( 1 ) versus primary care ( 0 ) specialty .
In this model , we examined the significance of the mediator and the change in the Wald 's t to determine if mediation was demonstrated ( condition 4 ) .
For the instances where mediation was demonstrated ( when all four conditions were met ) , we calculated the proportion of the relationship between relationship style and match in a primary care specialty that was mediated by the specialty choice factors , using the methods of Shrout and Bolger [ 29 ] .

The SNaPshot method has , however , previously been shown to be a sensitive and reproducible method for the detection of heteroplasmic mutations in different tissues [ 21 ] but since no heteroplasmic mutations were detected in the present study , and as no heteroplasmic positive controls were available for testing , we can not at this stage , comment on how well suited our method is for the detection of heteroplasmic mutations .
We have successfully developed a rapid , robust and cost-effective method for the screening of five of the known aminoglycoside-induced deafness mutations .
The SNaPshot technique is particularly well-suited for the screening of mitochondrial DNA variants for the following reasons : i ) the short intron-less mitochondrial genes means that the entire gene can be PCR-amplified and screened in a single PCR fragment and ii ) homoplasmic mutations ( such as the ones investigated in the present study ) are represented as a single peak at each locus which simplifies the analysis .

Over all health conditions , the total number of patients per day remained equal between the ' on alert ' and ' off alert ' periods ( 4,557.7 / day vs. 4,511.2 / day ) , but the number of elderly patients increased significantly during the ' on alert ' period relative to the ' off alert ' period ( 476.7 / day vs. 446.2 / day p < 0.05 ) .
Our results show the interest to monitor specific indicators during hot periods and to focus surveillance efforts on the elderly .

The following analysis demonstrates how this can be done ( and by implication , why it should be done ) , for an increasingly complicated set of examples .
A quick and easy way to avoid overstating precision is appropriate rounding , as taught to high school science students ( and largely ignored in health science reports , though a brief exposition of the point can be found in a recent epidemiology textbook [ [ 9 ] , p.51 ] ) .

The interpretation is straightforward and reflects the change in " x " per unit time .
However , if the reported length of follow-up from various studies is different , e.g. 6 months versus 1 year , then meta-analysis could involve the conversion of the study differences into a common metric prior to pooling .
This is often accomplished by dividing the per study differences between groups by the pooled standard deviation , a procedure known as the standardized weighted mean difference ( SMD ) [ 10 ] .

This method is known as the " bivariate model " [ 211 ] .
It preserves the underlying two-dimensional nature of the data and produces direct pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity , incorporating any correlation that might exist between these two measures .
The model can be extended to include explanatory variables leading to separate effects on sensitivity and specificity .
This method has two advantages over the standard methods : ( 1 ) the pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity take into account the correlation between these two measures ; ( 2 ) the effect of possible sources of heterogeneity on both sensitivity and specificity can be investigated in a single model rather than just looking at the effect of these variables on a single measure of test performance , the DOR .

Furthermore , we found that participants were willing to have a much smaller median difference in time to healing than the six weeks proposed by clinicians , and used in the original sample size for the study .
As such , researchers were able to feel confident in the patient acceptability of the intervention as the original sample size proposed greater differences in time to healing than that proposed by participants .
We found that using a relatively simple , interviewer administered questionnaire we could elicit meaningful information on the effect size for an intervention from participants .

Although descriptions of study characteristics and quality appraisal were presented alongside synthesised findings , the synthesis process obscured these in the conclusions .
We believe that further debate about the reliability of this approach would be useful .
On the one hand , the hypotheses that emerge from this synthesis draw on a broader body of views than any single study ( as in a meta-analysis ) and may therefore increase reliability ; on the other , we risk making strong conclusions based on a group of studies none of which is in itself reliable on the grounds of quality or diversity of context .

The demographic and occupational differences found between early refusers and individuals who neither refused nor consented early may have implications for survey research methodology and epidemiologic enrollment efforts .
If the characteristics that distinguish early refusers from other nonparticipants are associated with the variables under investigation , then standard methods of correction for non-participation could benefit from consideration of the heterogeneity among subgroups of nonparticipants .
For example , one approach to reduce non-participation bias is to use information from a sample of nonparticipants in the statistical adjustment of results for the participants [ 28 ] .
This method might provide more precise estimates of parameters in the target population with stratification by mode of non-participation , perhaps by sampling early refusers separately from other nonparticipants .

To test whether the difference of two responsiveness measures within a certain domain was statistically significant , the " modified Jacknife test " was applied [ 7 , 18 ] .
This method is a linear regression between the difference of the ES or SRM of two comparable scores ( e.g. between SF-36 bodily pain and MPI pain severity ) as dependent variable and the " centered " ES / SRM of one of the two scales ( which scale is not relevant ) as independent variable .

Adjustments for differences in case-mix were done using the Ontario AMI mortality prediction rule for 30-day mortality , whose derivation and validation are described elsewhere [ 26 ] .
The variables comprising the prediction rule consisted of age , gender , cardiac severity ( e.g. , congestive heart failure , cardiogenic shock , arrhythmia , and pulmonary edema ) , and comorbid status ( e.g. , diabetes mellitus with complications , stroke , acute and chronic renal disease , and malignancy ) , as derived from the ICD-9 codes present in the 15 secondary diagnostic fields of the hospitalization database .
An illness severity score was derived as the predicted probability of 30-day mortality using age , gender and the 9 risk factors and comorbidities comprising the Ontario AMI mortality prediction rule .
This method of constructing an illness severity score has been used elsewhere [ 27 , 28 ] .

In Figure 2 , we display the posterior distribution of the random intercepts for the eight hospitals that were classified as high-mortality outliers using at least one loss function .
One notes that of the eight hospitals that were classified as high-mortality outliers at least once , those hospitals that were identified as such more frequently tend to have posterior distributions that are shifted further to the right compared to hospitals that were identified less frequently .
For comparative purposes , model-based indirect standardization was used to identify hospitals that had higher than expected mortality [ 32 ] .

In fact , the BK-plot was originally introduced to elucidate Simpson 's paradox for the simplest case that both the treatment variable and the confounding variable are binary .
The plot then contains only two lines and two circles .
Insight comes from comparing the position of the two circles on these lines : If Simpson 's paradox is working , the lines have the same direction , do not intersect , and the circle on the lower line lies higher than the circle on the upper line .
This method of pairwise comparing circles does not work in the context of a large and maybe heterogeneous meta-analysis .

We concluded that this was a reliable and effective system for gene knockdown in E. histolytica .
This method has advantages over other methods used for gene silencing : the U6-shRNA expression cassettes are small ( 420 bp ) , appear to be active against different types of genes , yield significant knockdown , and the expression vector , once transfected , allows continuous expression of shRNAs , thus avoiding performing multiple transfections , and the shRNAs can be easily synthesized via PCR .

These results are consistent with the exon-definition model proposed by Berget , in which exons are defined in the context of genomic sequence by both flanking splice sites [ 35 ] .
Binding of the U1 snRNP to the 5 ' splice site of the exon facilitates recruitment of factors , such as SF1 and U2AF65 / 35 that recognize the upstream 3 ' splice site [ 36 ] .
Stabilization of the protein complex on the 3 ' splice site by these bridging interactions across the exon then facilitates interaction with the U1 snRNP bound to the 5 ' splice site of the previous exon allowing the intron to be defined [ 37 , 38 ] .
This method of exon definition may have evolved to minimize the recognition of cryptic 3 ' splice sites that are not associated with exons , as 3 ' splice site sequences are not strictly defined and occur with high frequency throughout the genome .

Indeed , in some cases , such as renal failure ( uric acid ) , icteric status ( bilirubin ) , hepatic damage ( hypoalbuminemia ) the increase or decrease of several metabolites modifies plasma antioxidant capacity , a situation returning to physiological values after correction of the underlying disease [ 38 ] .
In addition , high concentration of a number of metabolites , including uric acid , can lead to prooxidant effects , introducing a further decrease of the plasma antioxidant capacity [ 11 ] .
Recently , we have introduced a new automated method for the assay of the plasma antioxidant capacity , based on the bleaching of crocin .
This method ( the TAC assay ) gives an estimation of the integrated plasma antioxidant capacity .

There were a further four individuals who had a neuropathological diagnosis of PD out of a total of 339 brains examined from individuals who did not report PD during the interview phases .
The median time between their last negative PD self report and death was 3.0 years ( range 0.8 years to 4.3 years ) .
The frequency figures reported here have been based on self-reported diagnosis of PD among a large population based cohort of elderly people within the UK .
This method of detecting cases can potentially identify a greater percentage of medically diagnosed patients than using clinic or hospital records , since cases diagnosed within the primary care setting and not referred for specialist opinion will not be missed .

Patients were classified as persistent or nonpersistent at 12 months by comparing the discharge medication list with the 12 month medication list , if it was available .
Since patients derive benefit if they continue taking any drug within the drug category of interest ( eg. antihypertensive ) , we considered patients to be persistent for the drug category , not for the individual drugs .
Patients who switched from one drug to another were considered persistent for the purposes of this study .
This method will provide high estimates of persistence but will reflect a better " real-world " analysis of whether patients continue to take their medication after stroke .

Oligonucleotide or RNA probes are either labelled with radioactive atoms such as 35S or 32P , or other non-radioactive molecules such as biotin .
The location of the bound probe in the tissue is then usually visualised by autoradiography or immunohistochemistry , and captured as a digital image for quantification .
Images of autoradiographic films are analysed in a semiquantitative manner where the darkness of the film is proportional to the amount of gene expression .
This method is semiquantitative because the darkness of the film is only proportional to the amount of gene expression , but there is no way to map the darkness to the number of transcripts .

Although there remains controversy in how purely genetic these calculation are [ 35 ] and the best way compute heritability [ 36 ] we chose to calculate heritability in two ways .
First , using the classical approach , the proportion of variance attributed to additive genetic factors ( narrow sense heritability ) was estimated by doubling the difference in correlation between MZ and DZ twins .
This approach provides a simple and reliable index for twin studies which vary across time and culture [ 37 ] .
This method however , is ineffective at disentangling non-additive genetic factors and epistatic components as well and unique and shared environmental components .

The same can be said about the function of these clocks : while circadian clock cells in the brain control behavioral rhythms , the biological functions of clocks in peripheral tissues are minimally understood , except perhaps in the case of the antenna [ 14 ] .
Analysis of genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying circadian clocks in whole animals or isolated tissues is facilitated by the use of molecular reporters , such as firefly luciferase ( luc ) .
The use of firefly-luciferase ( luc ) as a real-time molecular reporter of gene expression has been illustrated in a variety of model systems including cyanobacteria , plants , Drosophila , and mammals [ 15-18 ] .
This method has proved especially valuable in studies about molecular rhythms because real-time expression of clock genes and other chronobiological factors may be monitored over many daily cycles in vivo   [ 17 , 6 , 19-21 ] .

In addition , averages of the LUC data computed across all records within a given group ( which varied as to body part , luc reporter type , and cry allele ) were obtained ; and such averaged time-courses were formally analyzed , as shown in Figures 3 , 4 and Figures 5 , 6 .
Consequently , there are differences between the Tables and Figures in values of parameters such as the Rhythmicity Index ( RI , see below ) , because the tables specify the means determined from individual-specimen analyses , while the figures provide parameters determined after computing the average time-courses .
Maximum Entropy Spectral Analysis ( MESA ) was employed to estimate the period of a rhythm , i.e. , for a given time-course previously determined to be significantly periodic by correlogram .
This method is presented in detail elsewhere [ 37 , 27 ] .

Given that the autocorrelation function is a good measure of the amplitude across the entire span of the signal , and that the rate of " decay " in this function reliably assesses the long-range regularity in the data [ 37 ] we employ an index derived from this function as a measure of how rhythmic the data are .
We assess the strength of the rhythm as the height of the third peak in the correlogram ( counting the peak at lag 0 as the first peak ) , terming this number the Rhythmicity Index , or RI ( see Figures 2 and 3 ) .
Statistical analysis employing the RI between different samples or groups is straightforward , because it is simply a correlation coefficient , which is normally distributed and dimensionless [ 35 , 37 ] .
This method was developed to measure and compare the strength of rhythms in Drosophila heart function [ see [ 25 ] , and especially 40 , for a more rigorous presentation of the method ) , as well as for circadian luciferase expression in dissected antennae [ 13 ] .

For each value of γ , the optimal algorithm considers both the mean and the variance of the output responses [ 32 , 33 ] , striking a balance between them that , overall , minimizes the average squared difference between the driven and the desired output rates ( Equation 11 ) .
Therefore , in Figs .
4c , 4d , the mean output responses are not quite the same for all data points ; in particular , for x = -15 and x = 10 there are small differences compared to the curves in Fig. 3 ( data not shown ) .

Since optimal behaviour would give choice that was a step function of probability ( i.e. it is optimal to choose the small / certain lever whenever the 4-pellet reinforcer is delivered with preinforcer < 0.25 and to choose the large / uncertain lever whenever preinforcer > 0.25 ) , a single-parameter continuous function approximating a step function was also used to predict subjects ' choice [ the logistic function y = 100 / e- ( x-m ) / b with y as the percentage choice of the large reinforcer , x as the programmed probability , b = 0.01 as an approximation to b = 0 and m as the free parameter ] , but this gave a poor fit ( r2 calculated as SSmodel / SStotal for a nonlinear fit : mean r2 = 0.26 ; note that individual values of r2 can fall outside the range [ 0 , 1 ] when calculated this way for nonlinear models ) [ 40 ] .
Consequently , since choice was best described as a linear function of probability , indifference probabilities were calculated for sham-operated and AcbC-lesioned rats , namely the probability at which rats were equally likely to choose the small / certain and large / uncertain reinforcers .
These were calculated via a linear regression of probability on choice ( i.e. a regression in which probability was predicted from choice ) .
This method has the potential to produce nonsensical probabilities for individual rats ( if , for example , an individual 's curve does not go both above and below the 50 % choice point in a given set of sessions ) but is nonetheless useful for group comparison .

However , if in addition to high cure , early hypothyroidism is also required ( ablative treatment ) , the only suitable method is through administration of a CalA , as at 11 MBq / g less that 5 % of patients will be euthyroid at one year , compared to 10 % given 250 Gy and 20 % given 555 Mbq .
From the model , a dose of 11-12 MBq / g predicts a 90 % hypothyroidism rate at one year .
For any further improvement in these non-ablative optimized regimens , what is required is some modification that increases cure while at the same time blunting the rise in hypothyroidism .
This method came to attention when it was noticed that doses estimated to deliver an AbsD or CalA to the thyroid ( after linear adjustment for size ) still resulted in higher hypothyroid rates in those patients with smaller goiters , and lower rates with increasing size of the goiter [ 35 , 38 ] as well as a significant rise in the percentage of patients still hyperthyroid with increasing gland mass [ 10 , 47 ] .

The cost of primary school was determined by obtaining current school fees for students at two non-governmental schools , a mission school and a private school .
Each of the schools was charging MK15,000 per term ( 3 school terms in a year ) .
At the prevailing foreign currency exchange rate of 1 US $ to MK 137 , the total tuition per student for the whole 8 years would be = 8 years × 3 terms × MK 15,000 = MK 360,000 i.e. US $ 2627.73 .
This method of estimating primary education costs has been used before by Kirigia et al [ 10 ] .

However , the patients were not assigned to different pain treatment methods depending on patient factors .
All of the patients were men , with the same diagnosis , who underwent the same kind of surgery and all patients were interviewed about their pain experiences in a consistent way and the result should therefore be valid .
Patients were asked once a day about their " worst pain " experienced during the preceding 24 hours , though it was not possible to meet all patients for an interview more often than once a day .
This method of pain assessment with an overall daily retrospective estimation may overlook periods with more or less pain [ 43 ] .

The slides were initially washed with distilled water and immersed for 24 h in potassium dichromate-sulphuric acid cleaning solution ( This solution was prepared by adding 63 gms of potassium dichromate to 35 ml of distilled water. Concentrated sulphuric acid ( 1 L ) was then added slowly down the sides of the bottle held in an ice bath with intermittent shaking to dissipate the heat generated ) .
Slides were removed and thoroughly washed in tap water , rinsed in distilled water , and air-dried .
They were packed in aluminium foil and sterilized by hot air oven for 1 h at 160°C .
This method of cleaning slides ensures that the charge of the glass surface is not alkaline and therefore , renders the surface suitable for cell adhesion ( an alkaline surface is unsuitable for cell adhesion and is caused by alkaline detergents ) .

For example , mechanical damage to the roots triggers the expression of " general " stress-responsive genes [ 15 ] , and may lead to false conclusions if such a " general response " is not involved in each stress treatment .
We previously developed a hydroponic culture system that enhanced rhizotoxicity while minimizing mechanical damage when changing culture solutions [ 16 , 17 ] .
This method has been applied to quantitative trait locus analysis of rhizotoxicities [ 18 ] and for monitoring root tip viability [ 19 ] , suggesting that it would also be suitable for obtaining root samples to determine the direct effects of rhizotoxins using microarray analyses .

Integrated analyses with other -omics data ( e.g. metabolomics ) would also be interesting to further our understanding of tolerance to and toxicity of rhizotoxic stressors .
There are limitations to our current approach , and several questions remain .
For example , we focused on the genes upregulated either collectively or specifically by four different ions .
This method excluded genes that were upregulated by two or three stressors , though they may also play an important role in defense and stress-response .

However , no significant changes in transcript levels were detected for both VvNPR1.1 and VvNPR1.2 after infection with downy mildew .
Overall , the constitutive expression of VvNPR1 and the absence of transcriptional regulation after pathogen infection suggest that VvNPR1 activity is regulated at the protein level in grapevine , as previously described in Arabidopsis [ 4 ] .
In order to address VvNPR1 function , particularly its subcellular localization and its ability to regulate defense gene expression , we first used an heterologous system for transient expression by agroinfiltration of N. benthamiana leaves .
This method has been described as a rapid and efficient system for the in vivo analysis of plant transcription factors and promoters of PR genes [ 38 ] .

Misoprostol has been widely recommended for the prevention of postpartum haemorrhage when other methods are not available [ 17 ] .
Apart from the prophylactic use of misoprostol in the third stage of labour , the therapeutic use of misoprostol for the treatment of postpartum haemorrhage has been promoted on the basis of unblinded studies .
In a systematic review [ 18 ] we located 6 uncontrolled reports ( 41 women ) [ 19-24 ] and one small , unblinded randomised trial [ 25 ] .
This method has entered clinical use , particularly in developing countries , without systematic research to document the optimal route and dosage , effectiveness or risks of this treatment .

In order to adequately represent the population of all singleton births , the only exclusions made were lethal congenital anomalies and obvious outliers which included any birthweights less than 250 grams .
Outliers were identified using Tukey 's methodology [ 12 ] .
This calculates the interquartile range and identifies as outliers any values more than twice the interquartile range below the first quartile or above the third quartile .
This method assumes a symmetric distribution which is not the case for birthweights at most gestational ages .

Haemorrhage was the commonest cause of all maternal deaths ( 25 % ) , but causation varied between the ante-partum , intra-partum and post-partum periods .
The cost of operating the surveillance system was US $ 386 a month , or US $ 0.02 per capita per year .
This low cost key informant surveillance system produced high , but plausible birth and death rates in this remote population in India .
This method could be used to monitor trends in maternal mortality and to test the impact of interventions in large populations with poor vital registration and thus assist policy makers in making evidence-based decisions .

The results presented in this paper are for women of the standard reproductive age group 15-49 years .
In the study all deaths to women aged 10-50 are recorded to ensure there is no under-reporting of maternal deaths due to age restrictions , as early marriage is common in this setting and many people do not know their exact age .
However , during the 110 week study period no maternal deaths have been found for this age-group and hence results presented in this paper are just for those aged 15-49 .
This method for measuring maternal mortality appears to be robust , but as with all methods for measuring maternal mortality in the community there are clearly some limitations .

As part of the SEA-ORCHID project baseline data collection , between January and December 2005 , we previously reviewed the medical records of 9550 women and their 9665 infants ( including 111 twins and two sets of triplets ) admitted to the labour wards at the nine participating hospitals .
Data were collected on a consecutive basis at five of the participating hospitals until a total of at least 1000 women 's medical records had been reviewed .
Cases were sampled using a variety of ratios at the four largest hospitals .
This method was used to ensure data were collected for a minimum of three months from each hospital and over similar time periods .

In the first method , comparisons were made in ridge counts between homologous fingers of the right and left hands using Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients ( r ) [ 43 ] .
The difference in correlation coefficients between cases and controls was calculated using Fisher 's z-transformation [ 44 , 45 ] .
The square of the product-moment correlation coefficient ( r ) is a measure of their common variance , and 1 - r2 is an estimate of error variance , and thus a measure of FA [ 46 , 47 ] .
This method ( henceforth referred to FA-correlation ) is not affected by directional asymmetry [ 10 , 11 ] and has been used in previous schizophrenia research [ 9 ] .

Our results emerging from a sample of familial schizophrenia patients are in line with previous studies in which two extreme clusters have consistently emerged , characterized by a well-performing and a dysfunctional group of subjects , and at least one intermediate [ 11 , 12 , 37 ] .
Our results agree with those in Sautter et al. [ 13 ] , in which neuropsychological data of familial schizophrenia patients formed three clusters with respect to the level of performance .
The fact that our findings , after including both affected and unaffected subjects agree with prior evidence , suggest further use of the cognitive traits as valid endophenotypes to be used in genetic linkage analyses .

The interview continued with the completion of various socio-demographic questions , including personal , family and judicial history .
At the end of the interview , each clinician independently summarized his or her list of diagnoses and scored the Clinical Global Impression severity scale ( CGIs , [ 10 ] ) ; finally , they met and concluded with a consensus list of diagnoses and a CGIs score .
It should be noted that the " junior " clinician who used the MINI did not know the formal MINI-generated diagnoses at the time when he or she made his or her own clinical diagnoses .
This method generates four series of diagnoses , corresponding 1. to patients for whom both clinicians independently made the same diagnosis ( strictly speaking , the two clinicians are not independent since the interview is the same. For convenience , we shall nevertheless use this term in the rest of the paper ) , 2. patients for whom at least one clinician made the diagnosis , 3. the consensus diagnoses and 4. the MINI diagnoses .

However , problem-solving therapies have not been adapted for use through the Internet , so we developed a new , generic method for multiple mental health problems that could be applied through the Internet .
As a general framework for the intervention , we used the model developed by Bowman and colleagues [ 19 , 20 ] , which is called Self-Examination Therapy ( SET ) , and we combined it with cognitive behavioral components and problem-solving procedures .
The general idea of SET is that subjects learn to regain control over their problems and lives by ( 1 ) determining what really matters to them ( 2 ) investing energy only in those problems that are related to what matters ( 3 ) thinking less negatively about the problems that are unrelated and ( 4 ) accepting those situations that can not be changed .

As a result of using verbal autopsy method , adult deaths ( ≥ 25 ) from unspecified and unknown causes decreased from 54 % to 23 % ( p < 0.0001 ) in urban and from 41 % to 26 % ( p < 0.0001 ) in rural areas in Tamilnadu .
Ten day training to write verbal autopsy reports followed by constant monitoring of the submitted reports resulted in arriving at the probable underlying cause of death for most of the deaths and to compute broad classification of the underlying causes of about 90 % of deaths in early adult life or middle age : in old age , however , the proportion classifiable is substantially lower .
The specific causes of death arrived based on verbal autopsy reports were used to estimate death rates for Chennai city [ 16 ] and to estimate the risk of death associated with smoking for broad groups of causes of death [ 18 ] .

The methodology used in 1995 was a convenience sample likely to have excluded remote primary health care facilities , which could have lead to an optimistic assessment of injection practices .
Second , we used the availability of selected types of injection devices during the field visit as an indicator of access .
This method may not have captured shortages that would have occurred before or after the visit .

It is generally believed that the measurements made on outdoor air are acceptable estimates of the population exposure [ 11 ] and it may be argued this is particularly applicable to communities with open air conditioning systems that provide excellent mixing of indoor and outdoor air .
Outdoor air pollution is especially important in large urban areas particularly in developing countries that have not been as successful as developed nations in controlling the sources of emissions .
Taking outdoor levels as a proxy for overall air pollution exposure , we estimated the levels of pollution in addresses of workplace and home that correspond to the places where people spend most of their time and took the higher level as the exposure measure .
This method is useful for investigating the acute symptoms resulting from air pollution exposure in contrast to the chronic effects which mostly correspond to the cumulative exposure levels during a long period of time and in different locations .

These epidemic indicators were defined retrospectively based on the incidence rate of meningitis exceeding 70 and 100 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in one year .
The epidemic peak was defined as the week with the highest incidence .
Retrospective analysis of the data was then performed to compare the ability of a number of different subdistrict weekly incidence thresholds to detect the epidemics early .
This method allows the timeliness of detection ( relative to the epidemic peak ) , sensitivity , specificity and predictive value to be calculated for each detection method and compared .

For all regions except North West Germany , where children were not selected from a population-based register , we considered non-response , both overall and due to : ( i ) failure to trace the family ( non-traceability ) , ( ii ) traced families declining to participate ( refusal ) , and ( iii ) traced families not being approached by researchers ( non-approach ) .
The significance of heterogeneity between regions was assessed using chi-squared tests .
The regions contributing to any significant heterogeneity were identified using a comparative risk function ( CRF ) [ 13 ] , which compares the odds of children in a specific region being in a specific category with the corresponding odds for the entire sample .
This method has the advantage of comparing each region with the entire sample and yielding confidence intervals which are independent , whereas logistic regression compares each region with one which is arbitrarily selected as the reference category and yields confidence intervals which are correlated .

In order to assess ventilation , two methods were used : the first method involved measuring carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) using a Langan T15 Personal Exposure Measurer ( Langan Instruments , San Francisco , CA ) , which measures concentrations in real time .
Calibration of these MIE and PAS instruments is described elsewhere [ 12 ] .
If the number of persons in the establishment is counted , the ventilation rate per occupant can be estimated from the difference between the indoor and outdoor CO2 levels by using an equation given by The American Society of Heating Refrigerating , and Air Conditioning Engineers ( ASHRAE ) in ASHRAE Standard 62-1999 [ 13 ] .
This method is based on carbon dioxide levels in exhaled breath , which will build up in an indoor environment limited only by the ventilation rate .

Effects of work factors on the level of psychological distress were examined with multivariate , linear regression models .
How to model the effects of exposures on a continuous dependent variable , measured at two points of time , is an unsettled issue that has created an extensive literature over the last three decades [ 47-49 ] .
We chose to examine effects of work factors on the level of psychological distress by comparing work factors with the follow-up scores of SCL-5 , and using baseline scores of SCL-5 as covariate .
This method has been recommended instead of comparing exposures with change scores ( follow-up scores minus baseline scores ) , because it controls for baseline imbalances between groups , and has a greater statistical power [ 48 ] .

For varenicline trials , we conducted pooled random-effects analyses of varenicline versus placebo at 1 year and at 3 months and for head-to-head trials of varenicline versus bupropion at 1 year and at 3 months .
Head-to-head trials provide the strongest inferences regarding intervention superiority [ 27 ] .
However , in the absence of head-to-head trials of varenicline versus NRT , we conducted indirect comparisons of these interventions versus placebo using methods described by Bucher et al and conducted z-tests to confirm [ 28 ] .
This method maintains the randomization from each trial and compares the summary estimates of pooled interventions with CIs .

Analysis of data from the nationwide Reproductive and Child Health Survey revealed that lower socioeconomic strata were over-represented among women seeking antenatal care at public hospitals in all major south Indian states , similar to the trend seen in the Guntur study .
Application of conservative correction factors derived from the Guntur study reduced the 2005 official sentinel surveillance based HIV estimate of 3.7 million 15-49 years old persons in the four major states to 1.5-2.0 million , which would drop the official total estimate of 5.2 million 15-49 years old persons with HIV in India to 3-3.5 million .
Plausible and cautious extrapolation of the trends seen in a recent large and rigorous population-based study of HIV in a south Indian district suggests that India is likely grossly overestimating its HIV burden with the current official sentinel surveillance based method .
This method needs revision .

Theoretically a large random sample of patients attending the emergency departments in each of the centres would be the ideal method to assess the overall burden of injury .
However , because minor injuries are more common than moderate or severe injuries , this would result in large numbers of people with minor injuries being recruited and very few with moderate or severe injuries ; which would result in very imprecise estimates of the burden of injury for moderate and severe injuries .
Therefore , we undertook quota sampling to ensure a mix of different types of injury at different levels of severity .

Prevalence ( 7 categories ) Surveys- Has a population representative survey about health-risks.- The population division is more reliable .
Prevalence-based analysis or prevalence-risks models are based on the different distributions of the risk of dying from various tobacco-related diseases in relation to the prevalence of tobacco consumption in the population .
To apply these methods it is necessary to know the prevalence of smoking in the study population , the total number of deaths due to diseases causally related to tobacco use , and a measure that summarizes the increased risk of dying due to these causes among smokers and ex-smokers .
This method is the most widely employed in the literature [ 4 , 6-51 ] .

The intra class correlation ( ICC ) represents the degree to which audit responses for patients seen by the same provider are similar to one another compared with those of patients from different providers .
The high ICC values indicate that the analysis must account for the variance between providers , supporting the choice of multi-level analysis [ 35 ] .
Multilevel logistic regression models were used with two dichotomous dependent variables adjusted for clustering of patients ( level 1 ) within providers ( level 2 ) [ 36 ] .
This method also has the advantage of allowing the proportion of variability attributable to each level of analysis to be determined [ 31 ] .

Despite the simplicity of the multiple sequence procedure , the results are very promising : OSS-HMM appears to be as good , maybe more efficient , than previous secondary structure prediction methods based on HMM that use evolutionary information .

Boden 's method captures flexibility in all three flexible regions , but it also predicts over 50 % of this sequence as flexible .
This method performs prediction based on the entropy of the predicted secondary structure , and thus the quality of the predicted secondary structure determines the prediction of a flexible region .

Although several previous studies have assessed the effect of GS on motor or myoelectric gastric patterns there are no results showing that these parameters can be modified by stimulation without having a significante effect on gastric emptying .

However , one of the problems with using differential equations is that each equation requires the knowledge of many parameters that make up the kinetic basis of the network interactions , which in many cases ( especially for large-scale models ) may be difficult to obtain [ 3 ] .
In addition , as the size and connectivity of the models increases , the complexity of the underlying differential equations also increases , limiting their use to only investigators trained in higher-level mathematics .
An alternative to differential equation modeling is the use of discrete models [ 3 , 13 ] .
This method is based on qualitative and parameter-free information ( e.g. , protein x activates protein y ) which is available in the biomedical literature and/or directly from laboratories , simplifying the process of building and modifying the models .

Also , at these accumulation potentials , MMC is so strongly adsorbed at the mercury electrode that the MMC layer can be washed and transferred to the electrolyte ( not containing any dissolved MMC ) , where it produces a response similar to that obtained with the electrode immersed in the MMC solution .
This method , termed transfer stripping voltammetry ( TSV ) , is useful for MMC determination in biological fluids containing interfering substances that are either not adsorbed at the electrode or that are separated in the washing step .

APD was measured to 90 % repolarisation ; so all measurements of APD in this paper correspond to APD90 .
We measured DI and APD in the centre of the strip .
We also measured the time difference between the action potential upstroke at the stimulus site and the action potential upstroke in the centre of the strip , and used this information to calculate CV restitution .
This method underestimates CV slightly , due to the action of the stimulus with the tissue edge .

An average deforestation rate has the advantage that it is consistent with other regional land-use change estimates and smoothes the short spatial and temporal changes , but it has the disadvantage in that it is fixed over time , since land-cover change is a disjointed process , with irregular periods of rapid change [ 64 ] .
The procedure for estimating carbon stocks and fluxes employed five steps : 1 ) an estimation was made of the average annual deforestation rate ; 2 ) projections of the area covered by Tamaulipan thornscrub was done using the average annual deforestation rate and as a baseline the area recorded from the last forest inventory of 2000 [ 21 ] ; 3 ) the rate of abandoned , fallow lands was estimated from other plant communities ( grasslands , agriculture , scrublands ) shifting to Tamaulipan thornscrub as a function of the area covered by Tamaulipan thornscrub and subtracted from the projected area covered by Tamaulipan thornscrub ; 4 ) carbon stocks in aboveground and root biomass were derived from biomass estimates using allometric equations and employing a biomass to carbon content factor of 0.50 ; and 5 ) SOC mass estimates were based on projections of soil bulk density with soil depth , soil mass per hectare basis , the annual rate of SOC depletion by shifting cultivation using the hyperbolic equation , the annual SOC increment in abandoned , fallow , agricultural lands .
The major assumptions of this methodology are : a ) the annual rate of deforestation and abandoned , fallow lands is constant over time , b ) there is a continuous shifting cultivation cycle of clearing , agricultural use , and fallow lasting 15 years ; c ) there is a mosaic of farms with different times of agricultural use and fallow ; d ) in agricultural lands SOC depletes in time to a minimum over 15 years as specified by equation [ 2 ] and in fallow lands SOC recovers in 15 years according to equation [ 5 ] ; aboveground and root biomass recover during fallow according to equations [ 6 ] and [ 7 ] , respectively ; e ) the carbon content in biomass is 0.5 ; d ) the soil bulk density function with soil depth remains constant in Tamaulipan thornscrub , agriculture , and fallow lands .
This methodology is quite similar to other procedures widely used to estimate carbon stock and fluxes [ 13-15 , 29 ] .

Previous research has suggested that for forests historically characterized by frequent , low severity fire , thinning the forest can reduce the risk of carbon loss from wildfire [ 11 , 12 ] .
Thus , FRCC-DEP can be altered , making this carbon valuation method robust to site-specific management actions , providing incentive in terms of increased carbon market value for landowners to engage in high severity fire risk reduction measures .
Substitution of FRCC and mFRI with the appropriate metrics would allow application of this approach to adjusting market value of forest carbon due to risks of other disturbances such as forest insect outbreaks and hurricanes [ 13 , 14 ] .

As with traditional Doppler , two or more pulses are sent successively along each scan line of the image and the pairs of echo trains are compared for the presence or absence of a frequency shift ( indicating movement ) .
However , unlike traditional Doppler , power Doppler ignores the direction and velocity of the moving structure ; if a frequency shift is detected , indicating motion of the structure , then colour is displayed as an overlay whose saturation is related to the amplitude of the echo which has moved .
If no frequency shift ( movement ) is detected , no colour is displayed .

Non-invasive methods [ 27-30 ] have been proposed to assess the rest-peak stress change in inotropic state , based upon the assumption that positive inotropic interventions are mirrored by smaller end-systolic volumes and higher end-systolic pressures ( Table 1 ) .
During bicycle stress echocardiography , dobutamine or pacing stress , continuous 2D echo monitoring is performed by protocol and blood pressure , ECG and left ventricular volumes are obtained at each step , providing the basic information required to build a force-frequency relationship over a wide range of frequencies ( Fig. 12 ) .
A totally noninvasive estimation of force-frequency relation during stress in the echo lab is theoretically appealing for the identification of limited contractile reserve and latent global left ventricular dysfunction .
This method is similar to the previously proposed ones but is totally noninvasive , with echocardiography used to assess LV volumes during exercise and cuff blood pressure to estimate peak systolic pressure as an index of end-systolic pressure [ 31-33 ] .

A positive LWPSD , i.e. a longer interval to maximal inward displacement of LV lateral wall than the interval to opening of the mitral valve , identifies a severe post-systolic contraction and has been demonstrated to be an independent predictor of CRT response in 48 patients with end-stage heart failure and left bundle branch block .
Of interest , despite evaluating intra-ventricular dissynchrony based on delay of a single myocardial wall , LWPSD could predict CRT response .
This may rely to the fact that , in the presence of left bundle branch block , the lateral wall is the latest to be activated , theoretically representing the optimal target for LV lead positioning .
This method has not yet tested in patients without left bundle branch block and its diagnostic accuracy is unknown .

Various methods have been proposed for calculating intra-ventricular dyssynchrony by SRI , some of which ( e.g. , % of LV base with delayed contraction ) predict accurately LV inverse remodeling after CRT but are complicate and requires considerable experience of the operator [ 32 ] .
One simple method , from Mele and coworkers , measures the standard deviation of the averaged time-to-peak-strain ( TPS-SD , ms ) of 12 LV basal and mid-segments obtained from the three standard apical views : a TP-SD of > 60 ms is associated with a good response to CRT in 37 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy , although sensitivity , specificity and accuracy have not been determined by this method [ 33 ] ( Figure 10 ) .
Another recent possibility , proposed by Porciani et al , considers the time spent by 12 LV segments in contracting after AVC , i.e. , during the isovolumic relaxation time , and measures the sum of the time of strain tracing exceeding AVC ( ExcT ) on the 12 LV basal and mid-segments ( cut-off value = 760 ms , 93.5 % sensitivity and 82.8 % specificity ) ( Figure 11 ) [ 34 ] .

A recent assessment of static and serial coronary artery remodeling clearly showed that cross-sectional comparison of sites with atherosclerotic lesions to a reference artery could result in misclassification of plaques as having constrictive rather than expansive remodeling [ 52 ] .
Our study defined the normal IMT and diameter values for each person based on the common carotid arteries of men and women who were free of both major atherosclerotic disease and of major risk factors with the gender-specific " normal " values being estimated for each person 's height , age , and race .
Thus , the expected IMT and diameter values to which the observed values are compared are likely to be free of the effect of major risk factors and so represent ideal values expected for someone of similar age , gender , height , and race .
This method can be used for other arterial sites where disease-free and risk factor-free values are available and could be used to identify diffuse remodeling , absence of remodeling , and constrictive remodeling .

However , strain is derived from the myocardial velocity gradient measured with TDI , from which the relative limitations in terms of angle-dependency are derived .

One caveat with this method is that most RNA-binding proteins bind to more than one mRNA , making it important to demonstrate that the tagged RNA-binding protein only associates with the appropriate transcript .
An elegant way to solve this problem is to target GFP to the mRNA by inserting binding sites for the MS2 phage coat protein into the mRNA and coexpressing an MS2-GFP fusion protein that also includes a nuclear localization signal ( Bertrand et al. , 1998 ) .
Since MS2 does not bind any endogenous RNAs in Drosophila , the fusion protein is targeted to the nucleus unless it binds to the MS2-binding sites in the transcript of interest and is exported with the RNA into the cytoplasm .
This method has been used successfully to study Ash1 mRNA localization in yeast ( Beach et al. , 1999 ; Bertrand et al. , 1998 ) , CaMKIIα3 and β-actin mRNA localization in cultured mammalian cells ( Fusco et al. , 2003 ; Rook et al. , 2000 ) , and nanos and bicoid mRNA in Drosophila oocytes ( Forrest and Gavis , 2003 ; Weil et al. , 2006 ) .

We observed almost no movement of cells into the wounded area in both untreated and control siRNA treated monolayers ( 4 cells and 6 cells respectively , Fig. 4A , 4B ) , while CCN5 knock down greatly increased wound coverage ( 123 cells , Fig. 4C ) .
VSMC in vivo must pass though the basement membrane of the endothelial cell ( EC ) layer to enter the intimal surface of the artery wall .
To mimic the in vivo process and to independently corroborate the scratch wound assay results , we employed transwell chambers coated with GFR-Matrigel , which may be thought of as a partially reconstituted basement membrane .
This method has been used previously by our laboratory to show that CCN5 overexpression reduces the ability of VSMC to migrate through a matrix environment [ 4 ] .

Hydrocephalus is a common neurological condition characterized by enlargement of the cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) -filled ventricles , which leads to damage of surrounding brain tissue [ 1 , 2 ] .
To study the pathogenesis of brain damage , hydrocephalus can be experimentally induced through a variety of techniques [ 3 ] .
The most widely used method is through the injection of kaolin ( aluminum silicate ) into the cisterna magna [ 4 ] .
This method is inexpensive , simple , reliable , minimally invasive leaving no visible wound , and to some extent titratable .

In our experience , IgE in the CSF and serum in eosinophilic meningoencephalitis caused by Angiostrongylus cantonensis is the immunoglobulin that shows the largest increase compared to IgA , IgG and IgM .
Consequently , intrathecal synthesis of this immunoglobulin can contribute to confirmation of the diagnosis , along with clinical symptoms , and can be an early marker of this neuroparasitosis .
The advantage of using the Reibergram for demonstrating IgE intrathecal synthesis is that it shows the fraction of IgE produced in the central nervous system , indicating the local response to the Angiostrongylus cantonensis third stage larvae .
This method takes into account IgE that enters the CSF from the serum and shows the additional amount found in the CSF due to local production .

By using an endonuclease which recognizes and cleaves at the polymorphic sites , the digestion of a longer PCR fragment into smaller fragments will change the banding pattern .
PCR-RFLP has been used for authentication of Panax species [ 14 , 35 , 36 ] , Fritillaria pallidiflora [ 37 ] , Atractylodes species [ 38 ] and differentiation of Codonopsis from their adulterants [ 39 ] .
Screening PCR products by using various restriction enzymes can be an alternative of sequencing to find out polymorphic regions among samples [ 34 , 40 ] .
This method is more reproducible than random priming methods , but it is limited by the degree of polymorphism among individuals within a species [ 25 ] .

Secondly , the reproducibility of RP-PCR patterns can be influenced by the quality , quantity and purity of DNA templates [ 86 , 87 ] .
Some researchers consider this to have a more significant effect to reproducibility than other factors such as enzyme quality or buffer conditions which may affect only the relative intensities of bands , but do not cause a band to appear or disappear [ 88 ] .
The number of bands produced can be greatly increased by adding bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) , which prevents various contaminants in impure DNA from binding to Taq polymerase [ 89 ] thereby stabilizing the polymerase [ 90 ] .
This method is , therefore , unreliable for identification of medicinal materials with impure or degraded DNA [ 91 ] caused by processing or long storage time .

ISSR [ 98 ] employs a primer containing simple repeat sequences for PCR amplification to generate fingerprints ( Figure 3 ) .
The primer can be 5 ' or 3 ' anchored by selective nucleotides to prevent internal priming of the primer and to amplify only a subset of the targeted inter-repeat regions , thereby reducing the number of bands produced by priming of dinucleotide inter-repeat region [ 98-100 ] .
Therefore regions between inversely oriented closely spaced microsatellites are amplified [ 101 ] .
This method relies on the existence of ' SSR hot spots ' in genomes [ 98,101 ] .

Similar to SSR , minisatellites are present in all organisms , making it possible to apply this method to any genome .
Examples include plants such as mulberry [ 78 ] and oilseed [ 109 ] , mushrooms Agaricus bisporus and Pleurotus [ 111 ] , animals such as human , snake and mouse [ 110 ] , insects such as mosquito and moth .
This method is more reproducible than RAPD due to the longer primers used [ 111 ] .

However , similar to ISSR , it only reveals polymorphisms in the regions rich in repetitive sequences , while RP-PCR can represent the polymorphisms of the whole genome [ 78 ] .
Moreover , polymorphic sequence must be obtained by cloning polymorphic bands prior to sequencing because of the same primer sequences at both ends of the PCR product .
SCAR [ 72 ] can be used for detection or differentiation of samples by using specific primers designed from polymorphic RAPD [ 72,112 ] or ISSR [ 113,114 ] fragments for PCR , leading to positive or negative amplification in target-containing and non-target-containing samples respectively [ 112,115 ] or amplification products of different sizes in the case of closely related samples [ 91,116 ] .
This method has been used for authentication of Panax [ 91 ] and crocodilian species [ 115 ] , and for discrimination of Artemisia princeps ( Kuihao ) and Artemisia argyi ( Aiye ) from other Artemisia herbs [ 112 ] .

As PCR inhibitory effects of ingredients in Chinese medicine can lead to false negative results , amplification of a control fragment using the same DNA template [ 114,115 ] or spiking control DNA amplifiable by the same primers to the sample DNA should be performed to ensure that the quality of sample DNA is suitable for PCR .
ARMS [ 117 ] is also known as allele-specific PCR ( AS-PCR ) [ 118 ] .
It refers to PCR amplification using primers which differ in the 3 ' terminal for distinguishing related samples .
This method is based on the fact that mismatches at the last base ( s ) at the 3 ' terminal of primers can lead to failure in PCR [ 119,120 ] .

MMT is employed by physical therapists to determine the grades of strength in patients with pathological problems and neurologic or physical injuries ( strokes , post-polio syndromes , fractures , post-surgical disabilities , etc. ) .
The physical therapist 's patients are often initially examined by a medical doctor who supervises the physical therapist 's rehabilitation programs that may involve isometric , isokinetic , and isotonic muscle training regimes for the gradual rehabilitation of muscle function ( often involving instruments and machinery ) .
In the absence of a pathological neurological deficit ( pathological deficits were originally what physicians sought to find using MMT ) , [ 25 , 26 ] clinical inferences are made based upon the result of the MMT .
This method of MMT is used in both chiropractic and physical therapy to determine a patient 's progress during therapy [ 3-9 , 20-23 ] .

Recommendations in these areas can therefore only be informed by expert opinion .
Data from studies undertaken in patient populations other than sepsis patients ( general intensive care unit patients or patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome , for example ) were included if there was no compelling reason to assume that the conclusions could not be generalized .

Briefly , proteins were separated on an SDS-PAGE gel copolymerized with 0.5 mg / ml gelatine .
After incubation in a buffer to activate the enzyme , the gel is stained with Coomassie Blue ( Sigma , Saint Quentin Fallavier , France ) : proteins with gelatinolytic activity are thus detected as unstained bands .
The quantity of enzyme is assessed by densitometry of the lysis bands , the area under the curve thus obtained being referred to a standard scale of purified gelatinase .
This method quantifies both latent and activated forms of MMP-2 and -9 , and , by addition , the total concentration of each gelatinase .

Electron tomographic reconstructions of both negatively paramyxoviruses and parapoxviruses demonstrated extensive flattening , while the fragmentation of the ribonucleoprotein strand of the paramyxovirus most likely results from shearing forces during drying .
This approach can thus be used efficiently to objectify the artefacts induced by negative staining , reviewed in [ 4 ] , which may be important to explain the large variations in size and morphology of identical viruses reported in literature .
Cryoelectron tomography of unstained specimens avoids these artefacts and is the method of choice for the visualisation of structures of complex viruses and their components [ 13 ] .

We used a two-stage selection procedure with a first non-random stage of selection of clusters .
Instead of randomly selecting clusters , we deliberately chose a group of clusters , which as a whole would contain all the variation in health measures in the population .
As there was no health information available before the survey , we selected a priori determinants that can influence the spatial homogeneity of the health characteristics .
This method yields a distribution of variables in the sample that closely resembles that in the overall population , something that can not be guaranteed with randomly-selected clusters , especially if the number of selected clusters is small .

For example , variation across wards is estimated first with no adjustment other than for Poisson variation , then with adjustment for specific risk factors , then also for variation across registers , and finally also for variation across hospital catchment areas .
For analysis at ED level , however , to avoid unnecessary technical complexity we adjusted for variation down to hospital catchment rather than ward level .
Spatial clustering not apparent in administrative areas was evaluated using a scan statistic [ 15 ] .

In households that had no children 6-59 months , only the household questionnaire was completed .
If the household had one or more children 6-59 months , a questionnaire was completed for each child 6-59 months living in the household , in addition to the household questionnaire .
A cluster was considered complete only when data were collected from the minimum number of households and the minimum number of children for that design ( e.g. , 30 × 30 design : minimum 30 households , 30 children per cluster ) .

Further investigation is required to determine whether these designs can consistently provide accurate point estimates for key outcomes of interest .
Organizations conducting cluster surveys in emergency settings need to build their technical capacity in survey design to be able to calculate context-specific sample sizes individually for each planned survey .
Over the past three decades , field surveys using a cluster sample design have become a standard , popular , and widely used method of measuring key nutrition and health indicators in humanitarian emergencies [ 1-4 ] .
This method was first widely popularized by the Expanded Program on Immunization ( EPI ) of the World Health Organization , which since 1978 has promoted using a 30 cluster design , with 7 children per cluster ( popularly known as " 30 × 7 " ) for measuring immunization coverage [ 5 , 6 ] .

The field applications of this method expanded rapidly to include measuring such key emergency indicators as acute malnutrition , crude and under-5 mortality , cumulative incidence of diarrhea and respiratory disease , access to safe water , prevalence of physical signs of micronutrient deficiencies , and several others [ 7-10 ] .
The challenges of measuring these indicators with sufficient precision triggered modifications to the initially proposed standard 30 × 7 design and led to the introduction of a recommendation for use of a 30 clusters of 30 children ( 30 × 30 ) design for measuring acute malnutrition in cluster surveys [ 11 , 12 ] .
Recently published field survey manuals [ 13 , 14 ] advocate calculating sample sizes and determining the number of clusters individually for each planned survey .
This methodology would allow for achieving the required level of precision while keeping the sample size and the number of clusters to a necessary minimum , thus providing for rational and efficient use of scarce time and resources in emergency settings .

Important questions about the appropriateness of the currently used GAM thresholds ( 5 % , 10 % , 15 % ) , their evidence base , and whether the concept of making decisions based on comparing the observed GAM prevalence to thresholds is meaningful or appropriate in all humanitarian situations is a subject of a separate debate and is beyond the scope of this paper .
It seems , however , that currently the most common way of classifying GAM relative to the thresholds is largely based on the observed prevalence estimate ( e.g. , if the GAM prevalence observed in the survey exceeds the threshold , then the area is declared above the threshold , and vice-versa ) .
From a purely statistical perspective , this means that GAM is declared above the threshold when the statistical probability of the true population value of GAM exceeding the threshold is above 50 % .
This method , theoretically , would produce as many false-positive as false-negative results .

A possible solution to the load-dependency of ejection-phase parameters was suggested looking at myocardial motion during the isovolumetric contraction period .
During this time period there is a velocity within the myocardium , probably related to the shape change from a more spherical ventricle to an ellipsoid shape ( Fig. 6 ) .
The acceleration of this velocity seems to be a good index for intrinsic myocardial function , relatively independent of load changes [ 55 ] .

The antioxidant potential of different aqueous plant extracts was evaluated by measuring their ability to suppress the oxidation of β-carotene as described by Vaya et al. ( 18 ) , with two minor modifications : the plant powder was dissolved in water instead of alcohol to a final concentration of 100 µg ml−1 and the spectrophotometric readings were taken at 454 nm .
The assay was performed at 50°C .
The OD454 readings of the rate of β-carotene bleaching were recorded at 20 min intervals for 2 h against the water blank .

The distribution of fragment lengths for each target fit well with the assumption of a random degradation process and , in keeping with our expectations , the estimated frequency of damage was always less in predator DNA than in prey DNA within the same sample ( mean λpredator = 0.0106 per nucleotide ; mean λprey = 0.0176 per nucleotide ) .
This study is the first to explicitly define the amount of template damage in any DNA extracted from faeces and the first to quantify the amount of predator and prey DNA present within individual faecal samples .
We present an approach for characterizing mixed , highly degraded PCR templates such as those often encountered in ecological studies using non-invasive samples as a source of DNA , wildlife forensics investigations and ancient DNA research .

The landmarks were then moved along the tangent either to produce the smoothest possible deformation from the reference form ( BEM ; [ 15-17 , 45 ] ) or to remove all variation tangent to the curve ( PP ; see [ 14 ] ) .
BEM alignment was carried out using the tpsRelwarp program ( version 1.39 , [ 41 ] ) .
The positions of the semi-landmarks ( along contours ) of each feather were allowed to slide along the direction parallel to the contours to minimize the bending energy necessary to produce the change in the contour relative to the reference form ( the GPA-estimated mean form ) .

" PCR-clamping " where peptide nucleic acids ( PNAs ) , locked nucleic acids ( LNAs ) , or morpholinos are used to suppress PCR amplification of wild-type or dominant sequences is one such method [ see [ 27 ] for a recent review ] .

Hence , a sequence-specific PNA probe overlapping one of the PCR-primer attachment sites within the target sequence of interest will not work as a primer .
This method has been widely applied to minimize amplification of the dominant sequence in the fields of clinical chemistry [ e.g. [ 30 ] ] , environmental microbiology [ e.g. [ 31 ] ] , parasitology [ 32 ] , and to detect genetically modified organism content in food [ 33 ] , but not to our knowledge in diet studies .

In total we were unable to identify 49 of our transcripts via Blast searches .
The reasons we failed to identify a number of transcripts could be partially embedded in the approach we took for studying global gene expression patterns .
Due to the methodology of the GeneFishing technique , we mainly amplify regions of the mRNA close to the polyA tail and the 3 ' UTR region of the transcript , which is not the most informative for identification of the gene , as it contains non-coding sequence .

Known as restriction enzyme mediated insertion ( REMI ) transgenesis , this method has been adopted across the Xenopus community with great enthusiasm .
The key to REMI transgenesis involves mixing transgene DNA with purified and permeabilized sperm , along with a small quantity of restriction enzyme and an extract of egg cytoplasm generated by high-speed centrifugation ( the key ingredient of which is thought to be nucleoplasmin , which serves to partially decondense the sperm chromatin , facilitating transgene insertion ) ; this mixture is then injected into dejellied eggs at the rate equivalent to about one sperm per egg .
Around a third of the recipient eggs usually cleave normally and a proportion ( around 50 % ) of these integrate the transgene into the genome during the first cell cycle .
This method produces large quantities of non-mosaic transgenics in the parent ( F0 ) generation , allowing experiments to be performed without the generation of stable transgenic lines .

Given this huge sample of unique RIX genomes , even modest quantitative differences between C57BL / 6 and other strains should be readily mapped ( or confirmed ) using the BXN and RIX mapping .
Knowing the precise location of breakpoints in RI lines also makes it possible to map modifier loci of mutations by making and phenotyping a set of different F1 crosses made between inbred carrier stock ( for example , a knockout carried on a C57BL / 6 background ) and fully typed RI lines .
A set of these RI backcrosses ( RIB ) has a genetic structure similar to a conventional N2 backcross , but there is no need to genotype any of the RIB progeny and they have the major advantage that isogenic progeny can be typed to obtain much more reliable trait scores .
This method does depend on either a dominant or semidominant mutant allele , since the phenotype must be detectable on a significant fraction of the RIB progeny .

The two draft sequences have been produced using different methods .
The IHGSC started from a clone-based physical map of the genome [ 8 ] , while Celera used the whole-genome shotgun method to produce the sequence .

This method was chosen over the whole-genome shotgun approach on the basis it would minimize the problems associated with assembling a repeat-dense genome ( now known to be more than 50 % repetitive sequence ) and that it would speed the process of finishing the remaining gaps .

Although the yNup188 and vNup188 have limited sequence similarity , the presence of the two proteins in similar complexes suggests that they and their associated proteins form a conserved subcomplex within the NPC .

To make the verification of the classification results more straightforward we introduce a representation of classifiers in the form of simple rules .
The following language for rules is used : ' +A ' means that gene A is ' upregulated ' ; ' -A ' that gene A is ' downregulated ' , ' ⇔ ' is used for simultaneous events , ' ⇒ ' is used to distinguish between events that are divided in time .
For instance , +A+B⇔-C means that C is ' downregulated ' when A and B are ' upregulated ' ; +B⇒+A means that A is ' upregulated ' if B was ' upregulated ' ( for example , in the previous time point for the time series ) ; ↑A↓B⇔↓C means that positive change in the expression level of A along with simultaneous negative change in expression of B coincides with simultaneous negative change of C expression ; ↑B⇒↓A means that positive change in expression level of B precedes negative change of A expression .
This method of representation allows the decomposition of decision trees of complex structure into simple and compactly presented relations , which can be independently compared to the existing knowledge .

This paste-and-go functionality is not available within the other two programs , both of which require substantial time to create files of genes for gene lists and gene populations in an acceptable format .
In the case of MAPPfinder , the GenMAPP program must create these files after loading a dataset , and in the case of GoMiner , the files must consist of HUGO symbols .
EASE rapidly converts a list of genes into an ordered table of robust biological themes that summarize the biological result of the experiment .
This method has immediate utility for finding themes that most differentiate lists of genes , for example upregulated versus downregulated in a single experiment , but could potentially be applied to compare the results of different experiments , even involving different species and/or technology platforms .

The THoR analyses are optimized so that for any subsequent runs of THoR for the given alignment ( An+1 ) , only those sequences that are novel when compared with the previous alignment ( An ) will be subjected to PSI-BLAST searches and only results from these searches will be appended to those emanating from the previous runs of THoR .
The following benchmarking tests were used to investigate the performance of THoR .

Peptides are then eluted from the RP column and enter the mass spectrometer for analysis .
After the RP gradient is complete , the next step of the salt gradient releases another subset of peptides from the cation-exchange column onto the RP column , and the process repeats itself .

The total TE content of the compact genome of A. thaliana , with a haploid size of approximately 150 Mbp ( million base-pairs ) , has been previously estimated as around 10 % , and is known to cluster around the pericentromeric heterochromatin [ 14 ] .
Despite the relatively low copy numbers , there is a high diversity of LTR-RTs in A. thaliana [ 22 , 23 ] .

The rapid and recent genome evolution inferred for A. thaliana may be a feature common to other higher eukaryotes , in particular those with compact genomes .
High turnover of TE insertions in euchromatin also occurs in Drosophila and pufferfish [ 53 ] , for example , and accumulation of TEs into heterochromatin in those genomes may also , as in A. thaliana , be due to diverse evolutionary mechanisms .
A methodology was developed for the automated mining of sequence data to retrieve the sequence and chromosomal location of genomic ' fossils ' of LTR-RTs , identifying complete elements and solo-LTRs among the retrieved sequence fragments , and estimating the age of the insertion events that gave origin to these elements .
This methodology was applied to the genome sequence of A. thaliana .

The peak of the standard MPT defines standard body time ( BTS ) , which is 12 for a tissue collected at ZT = 12 .
If the MPT curve derived from an individual deviates from the standard MPT , this individual 's body time is not ZT = 12 ; as illustrated in Figure 2c , this is ZT = 10 for individual 1 ( BT1 ) or ZT = 14.5 for individual 2 ( BT2 ) .
If the difference in BT compared to the standard BT is larger than the error , the shift in internal timing of the body compared to a standard can be considered ' real ' .
This method does not only allow determination of individual body time , it is also useful to reveal gross alterations in the functioning of the circadian clock .

In this way the observed couplings and chemical shifts can be related to the orientation of the atomic sites with respect to the bilayer normal , which is aligned parallel to the magnetic field .
As for the dipolar waves described above , the spectra of uniformly aligned samples in which the 15N-1H dipolar interaction is correlated with the 15N chemical shift , result in circular patterns of resonances for α-helical segments with 3.6 resonances per turn , reminiscent of helical wheels .
Here the patterns , known as PISA wheels [ 46 , 47 ] , represent an opportunity to assess helix tilt angles and orientations without the need for , or with minimal , resonance assignments , respectively .

Therefore , the size of this gene family might reflect the more pathogenic lifestyle of Salmonella .
To address these questions , extended gene families were identified , where a gene was not allowed to belong to more than one family .
Thus , if gene A matched gene B , and gene B matched C , but A did not match C , all three were considered part of the same family , as it is likely that they are all evolutionarily derived from each other [ 34 ] .

To detect potentially homologous genes we started by carrying out an all-against-all BLASTP [ 40 ] search of every protein sequence in one genome against every protein sequence in all the other genomes .
We then recorded the best reciprocal hit for each protein sequence with an E-value lower than 10-5 and sequence identity higher than 50 % over more than 60 % of the length .
To validate the results , we performed some representative comparisons by studying the distribution of the ratio of bit score to the maximal bit score [ 41 ] .

PathoLogic then tries to determine the metabolic reaction catalyzed ( if any ) by each gene product in the organism by using its EC number , if provided in the annotation , and by matching the name of each gene product against the extensive dictionary of enzyme names within the MetaCyc DB [ 15 ] .
Finally , the list of reactions now known to be catalyzed by the organism is matched against all the pathways in MetaCyc .
For pathways with significant numbers of matches ( see [ 36 ] for a detailed description of this algorithm ) , PathoLogic imports the pathway and its associated reactions and substrates from MetaCyc into the new PGDB .
This method of pathway prediction is analogous to predicting the function of a protein based on sequence similarity to a protein of known function , in that both methods recognize the presence of something known ( a known pathway versus a known protein function ) based on a similarity between patterns ( a pattern of enzymes present versus a sequence pattern ) .

We used two different methods to compare the actual codon usages to randomized codon usages .
First , we used ' shuffled ' codon usages .
In shuffled codon usages , the codons , amino acids , or positional-base frequencies were randomly permuted .
This method preserves the relative frequencies of the the different codons , amino acids , or positional-base frequencies , but changes their meanings .


./Genome_Biol/Genome_Biol-6-11-1297647.nxml.sentences
To predict the codon usage associated with an amino-acid usage , we used the assumption that all codons coding for the same amino acid occur with equal frequencies , so that each gets an equal share of the amino-acid frequency .
Consequently , blocks of codons ( coding for the same amino acid ) are assigned the same frequency .
The prediction of the frequency of a codon from a positional-base usage is calculated as the product of the positional-base frequencies of its bases at the three codon positions .
This method reflects the idea that if a species were under selection for amino-acid usage only , there would be no a priori reason to assign different frequencies to the different codons for a given amino acid .

In part this may be a methodological artifact as we assume that all genes not present in the network have an average distance , and most genes are not in the network ( a more restricted study , examining only those genes featured in the networks , corroborated their relevance ; see Materials and methods ) .
We keep nevertheless both predictors in our study as controls .
In summary , this analysis confirms the relevance of several aspects of gene expression control and genetic linkage as predictors of synteny conservation in yeast .

This can cause problems when the presence of a single inferred reaction causes the creation of an entire phantom pathway .
For example , cytochrome c ( UniProt P99999 ) is very well conserved across eukaryotes , and so reaction in which this protein is released from mitochondria during apoptotic cell death is inferred in all of these species and causes creation of a pathway , ' apoptosis ' .
For this reason we are considering implementing a more sophisticated future criterion in which a minimum number of reactions is necessary to create a pathway .

The result is that the distribution of P ( wt | cj ) over all n-grams will be more similar to that of the proteome , while retaining the relative probabilities of each class within individual n-grams learned from the labeled data .
Solving for P ( cj | X ) is difficult because we do not know the distribution of subcellular localizations in a given species , and neither can it be observed before classification .
However , we incorporate the proteome for species X using a LaPlacean-type of estimate , adding the proteome data to each class .
This method can cause the probability estimates for P ( cj | X ) to become more uniform in proportion to the size of the dataset of the proteome ( Dx ) being considered .

The largest protein identified under both conditions was DNA directed RNA polymerase beta chain ( Mr = 153,688 Da ) .
The most acidic protein identified under both conditions was the 30S ribosomal protein S1 ( pI = 4.28 ) while the most basic in the early growth condition was the 30S ribosomal protein S5 ( pI = 10.49 ) and in the late growth condition was the 30S ribosomal protein S20 ( pI = 11.63 ) .
Proteins identified within the two growth conditions were quantified using the Exponentially Modified Protein Abundance Index ( emPAI ) and can be seen in Table 1 ( for those proteins unique to early phase growth ) , Table 2 ( for those proteins common to both growth conditions ) and Table 3 ( for those proteins unique to late phase growth ) [ 37 ] .

This gives rise to a divide-and-conquer algorithm that simultaneously defines appropriate contexts and estimates p-values for all regions of any multiple alignment ( see Materials and methods for details of the algorithm ) .
The p-value of a single site for a branch k is the p-value of the score of the segment that contains that site for the null hypothesis case k .
After computing the p-value for every branch of the phylogeny and for every segment , we identify the branch ( or branches , in case of a tie ) having the greatest p-value for each site : this maximum p-value is the ' discordance ' of that site .

Fortunately , a number of complementary methods have arisen to enable researchers to accurately study gene gain and loss at a genome-wide level .
The most commonly used methods compare the species tree that describes the relationships among taxa to the gene tree inferred from the sequences of the gene family being studied [ 9-14 ] .
By reconciling the gene tree with the species tree , both gene gains and losses can be inferred and mapped onto the species tree .
This method has been applied to many individual gene trees ( for example , [ 15 ] ) , and is only now finding wider usage in whole genome analyses ( for example , [ 16 ] ) .


./Genome_Biol/Genome_Biol-8-7-2323230.nxml.sentences
I consequently define these branches of the species tree as ' informative , ' and use them in further comparisons below .
A further possibility to account for reconciliation bias on non-informative branches is to iteratively remove descendant branches from the gene trees to be reconciled .
Because incorrect duplications are placed on these branches only when there are genes from three or more descendant branches , pruning the trees so that only two or fewer lineages are represented may allow for more accurate reconstruction of the number of duplicates on these branches .
This method then essentially turns ' non-informative ' branches into ' informative ' branches by reducing the possibility that gene trees are incorrect .

Each node ( gene ) is assigned an initial cycling score that is determined from expression data using a method from de Lichtenberg and coworkers [ 13 ] .
Starting with this score , we propagate information along the edges of the graph until convergence .
Thus , if a node with a medium to high score is connected to a set of nodes with high scores , then the information from the neighboring nodes can be used to elevate our belief in the assignment of this node , and vice versa .
This method allows us to identify several cycling genes that can be missed in an analysis focused on a single species as a result of expression noise ( Figure 1 and Additional data file 1 [ Supporting Figures 1 to 3 ] ) .

For dual-channel cDNA arrays , several normalization methods have been proposed ( for example , [ 2 , 6 ] ) , but these procedures typically utilize methods that neglect probe sequence information and are also computationally expensive and , thus , unsuitable for currently available high-density tiling arrays .
One common way of locally normalizing two-color arrays is the so-called M-A loess normalization .
The fundamental assumption behind this procedure is that most probes should have similar values between the two-channels , an assumption violated in studies of chromatin structure such as nucleosome mapping described in [ 7 , 8 ] .
This method also does not account for sequence-specific effects , which may be significant in high-density tiling arrays , and also does not normalize the variance of M .

Also implicit in the model is that although different GC bins are allowed to have different proportions of non-background probes , the signals of non-background probes are shifted across GC bins by the same mean , variance , and covariance as the background .
where nk is the number of probes with GC = k .
We further scale the t-values globally so that the rescaled t-values have variance 1 .
This method has the following geometrical interpretation as seen in Figure 6 : assuming that Cy3 is the control and Cy5 the treatment channel , let { e1 , e2 } define an orthonormal basis of R2 , where each probe pi , with log intensities xi1 = log ( Cy3i ) and xi2 = log ( Cy5i ) , corresponds to a point Xi = xx1 e1 + xi2 e2 ∈ R2 .

However , we prefer to use observed values here , because deconvolved values are only applicable to genes that are involved in the cell cycle .
In this work , we have also been interested in other genes that are involved in other pathways but that might also be regulated in the synchronized yeast cell cultures , which were originally used to study cell-cycle regulation .
In addition , de Lichtenberg et al. [ 62 ] once proposed an approach in which the timescales are first transformed from minutes to percentages of the cell cycle in different experiments in order to obtain one integrated global peak time .

Another particular problem concerning transgenesis is that founders that develop from the injected oocytes or eggs are predominantly mosaic for the transgene , because integration generally occurs relatively late during embryonic development .
Therefore , in order to promote successful transmission of the transgene through the germline to the next generation , it is necessary to shift the window of integration events to as early as possible .
This can be facilitated by co-injection of engineered transposons with transposase mRNA .

Although smokeless tobacco ( ST ) use has played a major role in the low smoking prevalence among Swedish men , there is little information at the population level about ST as a smoking cessation aid in the U.S.
We used the 2000 National Health Interview Survey to derive population estimates for the number of smokers who had tried twelve methods in their most recent quit attempt , and for the numbers and proportions who were former or current smokers at the time of the survey .
An estimated 359,000 men switched to smokeless tobacco in their most recent quit attempt .
This method had the highest proportion of successes among those attempting it ( 73 % ) , representing 261,000 successful quitters ( switchers ) .

Randomisation was stratified by two variables in order to provide a control for what were perceived to be potentially important influences .
The stratification variables were the " Treatment Centre " that the client was recruited from , to control for differences in standard service at each of the recruitment sites , and " Injecting Equipment Sharing Behaviour " , to control for a very important risk-factor predictor for contracting hepatitis C .
Stratification was achieved in blocks of six within each variable , such that in each block of six half of the clients would receive SEC and half of the clients EPC .
This method of stratified randomisation was chosen over true randomisation in order to ensure that allocation to either group was fairly constant throughout the life of the trial , helping to maximise therapist time by spreading the workload more evenly .

The distribution of the propensity score was divided into deciles , and stratified random samples of 400 from the first through the eighth deciles were drawn from both the proxy-completed responses and the self-completed responses ( table 5 ) .
Due to the large size of decile one , the stratified random sample was selected from the midpoint of that decile .
Due to the small size of deciles nine and ten , 200 were drawn from the ninth decile and 50 were drawn from the tenth decile for both groups ( see table 5 ) .
This methodology had the effect of providing a sample that was reasonably well distributed between the groups with respect to the characteristics that helped to determine proxy-completed responses .

It was recognized that the psychometric validity of such an instrument would depend on its ability to describe normative group similarities and differences , but that the real value would be determined by its ability to help to strengthen clinician-patient relationships and facilitate three central objectives of good patient care : 1 ) To foster meaningful patient-centered dialogue and supportive therapeutic relationships [ 24 ] ; 2 ) To identify patients with special needs for adjunctive support ; and 3 ) To characterize patients ' experience of the illness-health progression as well as the experiential impact of interventions over time .
Also at issue was the need to assure the general relevance of the measured dimensions across a wide range of patient groups .
In this regard it was necessary to break rank with typical approaches to designing disease- and symptom-specific HRQL instrumentation , since they are based on the premise that measures depend on a careful specification of disease-specific contexts and experiences .
This method of gaining measurement precision was not seen as feasible across disparate and heterogeneous patient populations .

However , as the response burden of this 20-item questionnaire is already low ( time to complete the questionnaire rarely exceeds 10 minutes ) , and in order to be able to calculate the overall QOL score , we generally recommend using the instrument in its full length .
The most important difference between Stoma-QOL and other instruments intended for stoma-patients is that the items in Stoma-QOL were generated by the primary source , the stoma patients themselves .
The initial item generation was designed to get the patients to describe all their daily life concerns within the five pre-selected domains .
This method , in our opinion , is preferable compared to item generation based on literature , experts and other second-hand sources .

This method will appropriately adjust for any baseline imbalance that we may observe , and provides the most powerful analysis [ 57 , 58 ] .

Researchers identified a set of women as ' positive deviants ' because their children were thriving despite high rates of childhood wasting and stunting in their rural villages .
The women were including in their cooking pots tiny shrimps and crabs , found in large numbers in rice paddies but not normally used because fish were generally thought to be inappropriate for young children [ 18 ] .
The subsequent randomized controlled trial showed significant improvements in health outcomes of children fed in this way [ 12 , 17 , 19 ] .
This method of food preparation was then disseminated and sustained years after the original studies [ 20 ] .

Ideally each individual should have his own correction derived from multiple ECGs at different heart rates and conditions to get the ideal correction constant .
Since this is not feasible a compromise can be made by using formula which have been developed and validated in a large population based cohort like the Framingham study [ 1 ] .
Alternatively , a table of lower and upper limits of QT interval for different RR cycle lengths can be used by clinicians for references purpose [ 4 ] .

Atrial pacing is performed at the mapping catheter at different locations closed to the theoretical location of the AcP aiming to reproduce that interval .
A difference between the activation time in tachycardia and during pacing lower than 5 ms identified sites with the maximum probability of ablation success .
The highest predictive value of success was reached when the following criteria were fulfilled : difference between activation times shorter than 5 msec , V / A local index lower than 1 , and a stable local electrogram ( EGM ) .
This method is complementary with traditional mapping criteria [ 13 ] and its maximum usefulness is foreseen after non-intentional induction of AcP mechanical block , avoiding procedure discontinuation .

A hand-held cryoprobe was applied at the site where intraoperative mapping localized the arrhythmogenic substrate .
The probe was refrigerated to -60°C and its effectiveness was evaluated during continuous monitoring of the cardiac electrical activity .

It is a method which is based on the electrical property of the heart after a ventricular ectopic beat and can be measured from a 12 lead electrocardiogram or holter monitoring .
Immediately post ventricular ectopic beat the native ventricular response accelerates ( due to baroreflex activity because of decreased cardiac output ) and followed by a slow deceleration back to normalcy .
Measurement of these variables when studied along with other risk factors has shown superior risk prediction for sudden cardiac death .
This method however will need to be validated with prospective clinical studies .

The tangent method determines T offset as a tangent to the steepest point of the descending limb of T wave or with a line trough the T wave peak and the maximum slope point [ 16 ] .
Since the methods based on Holter recordings describe the natural adaptation of the QT interval to changes in heart rate , it is important to use software which performs “beat-to-beat” analysis [ 3 , 14 , 17 , 18 ] .
Both linear and non-linear methods of assessment of QT dynamics have been described .

Figure 3 is an example of QT hysteresis during a 5 minute heart rate change recorded on Holter .
Since the heart rate varies over time , the QT / RR relationship is not constant and the QT changes tend to lag behind the heart rate changes .
One approach to the evaluation of this natural behaviour of QT dynamics is to evaluate it over several minutes of stable narrow ranges of heart rate .
This method , however , causes loss of information regarding QT dynamics over different ranges of heart rate .

In some cases , however , mapping and subsequent ablation of the ventricular insertion has been achieved leading to successful clinical outcome as described by the case report by Valentino et al in this issue of the journal [ 23 ] .
Shortest interval from stimulus to ventricular activation is defined as the shortest interval between the pacing sites at different sites at the RA side of the tricuspid annulus to the earliest preexcited QRS .
The result of RF ablation at the site of the shortest interval has remained inconsistent as seen in various studies and varies from 0 to 100 % [ 10 , 17-20 ] .
This method is time and labour intensive and very inaccurate because it is difficult to stimulate from many sites at the same distance from the annulus .

A 50 metre buffer was chosen to ensure that parcels along the selected roads would be included but that most parcels located further from the road ( e.g. behind those adjacent to the road ) would not be selected .

In this methodology a road network buffer that was 950 m long and 50 metres wide was constructed to assess aspects of land use that may influence walking .
Previous methods to construct a network-based local neighbourhood have used journey endpoints ( e.g. 1 km along the road network ) as vertices from which to build a polygon delineating the neighbourhood .
This method presents a vast improvement over the simple circular buffer method because it takes into account that the area of a " local neighbourhood " is necessarily restricted by the manner in which one is able to traverse the landscape - a pedestrian can not travel " as the crow flies " but is instead forced to travel along existing roadways .

Instead of capturing 50 % of an area 's unit , the distance based boundary method selects any units boundary that is either wholly contained , partially intersected or tangent to a specified distance , centered on the environmental hazard considered to be in the host neighborhood [ 2 ] .
To further explain , this method includes the host tract and " contiguous " geographical areas that either share , or have a portion of its unit within a specified distance , as in this case , a one-mile distance from the host tract .
This method differs from the unit-hazards approach because it only includes contiguous tracts within a specified distance .

This deformation in the nanostructures upon liquid interaction poses a serious problem for their application in functional biosensor devices because biosensors will have to be exposed to one or more aqueous environments .
Therefore , to be useful as a component in a biosensor , these nanostructures need to have sufficient mechanical strength to overcome the capillary forces .
To address this issue , we developed an aqueous-based electrochemical deposition technique to fabricate vertically aligned standing nanostructures ( nanopillars ) .

A rapid method to detect the onset of apoptosis is a useful adjunct to the monitoring of surrogate tissue in order to evaluate the effects of new cancer therapies in clinical trial settings .
In the study of apoptosis , focus has largely been placed on methods that address the different stages of apoptosis following treatment of cells with apoptosis-inducing agents .
For example , the Annexin V assay is associated with the monitoring of changes in the proteins of the plasma membrane .
This method , as with many other assays associated with the detection of apoptosis , is flow cytometry-based ; early-phase apoptotic cells have exposed phosphatidyl serine ( PS ) residues to which FITC-conjugate Annexin V binds .

Pineal microdialysis offers an exceptional technique for measuring quantitative changes in circadian melatonin secretion [ 14 ] .
This method enables real time analysis of a single individual , and therefore can prospectively measure quantitative circadian responses to environmental changes , pharmaceuticals , and potentially disease states .

Interviewees were chosen without distinction of gender , and after seeking oral consent from each respondent .
During the interviews , a standardized set of questions was used to inquire about each plant the authors collected .
Showing interviewees the collected plants and asking them questions about each plant was preferred over asking them to recall , from memory , which plants they used .
This method was preferred over pure questionnaires because it enabled information gathering about species that are known by the community , but no longer used .

One advantage of this technique is that a variety of animals can be captured in the same kind of trap .
Nevertheless , many animals without food value ( in the hunters ' opinion ) can be captured , such as snakes or " timbus " .
These animals , besides having little use , can sometimes provoke fatal accidents ( as in the case of snakes ) .
This method uses an adhesive made ( or bought ) by the " passarinheiros " ( people who specialize in capturing and selling birds ) that is applied to a stick - and when a bird lands on the stick it becomes stuck to the glue .

Most generally approve of gifts19 and believe accepting them is appropriate because they learn about new products.18 However , physicians do not want gift relationships made public20 and they acknowledge that gifts can compromise objectivity.16
These surveys identify a striking contrast between physicians’ awareness of the negative effects of detailing and their approval of the relationships .
To analyze how physicians resolve this contradiction and to explore the policy implications , we conducted a series of focus groups .
This methodology was selected not to quantify the distribution of physicians’ attitudes but to go beyond survey findings to an in-depth investigation of physicians’ reasoning .

First , we calculated the number of months subjects spent above goal before initiating insulin therapy ( or end of follow-up ) .
Second , we observed the level of A1C reached before insulin initiation ( or end of follow-up ) .
Finally , we estimated overall glycemic burden as defined by Brown and colleagues—the cumulative amount by which A1C exceeded the 8 % treatment goal .
This method sums the difference between measured or interpolated A1C and goal over all observed months ( one unit of glycemic burden is equivalent to 1 month of A1C at 9 % , or 10 months of A1C at 8.1 % ).15 The result is expressed in “A1C months” .

Preliminary tests found that if a sample plate was scanned , allowed to sit for 30 minutes ( the time required for RNase reaction ) , and rescanned , fluorescence decreased by 10 % , thus requiring the addition of control wells to estimate a “fading factor” correction .
This “fading factor” is eliminated by the use of the three-plate method .
While the use of three plates increases reagent requirements , this cost is more than offset by increased confidence in the data .

The problem of obtaining purified DNA presents an obstacle for the vast numbers of bacterial species that have not yet been cultured in vitro , such as those that live in structured communities with other microorganisms or as obligate symbionts residing exclusively in the tissues of animal and plant hosts .
There is a recognized need to develop culture-independent approaches that will permit access to the genomes of bacteria that are environmentally or medically important ( DeLong and Pace 2001 ; Cummings and Relman 2002 ) .
One method of obtaining information about individual genomes from complex assemblages of organisms is by cloning heterogeneous DNA samples into large insert BAC libraries ( Beja et al. 2000 ) .
This method was first used to recover DNA from a mixed microbial population collected at a depth of 200 meters in the Pacific Ocean ( Stein et al. 1996 ) .

In the above , we used a cubic expression to determine the correctness of the functional response curves because a cubic expression will often provide a good fit to a type III response ( Trexler et al. 1988 ) and will provide a good starting point for fitting a logistic regression ( Trexler and Travis 1993 ) .
Higher order expression will , of course , fit even better , but this improved fit is usually the result of a better fit to points at higher values of No .
After the determination of the shape of the curve , the handling times and attack coefficients of a Type II response were estimated using Holling 's disc equation modified by reciprocal linear transformation ( Livdahl and Stiven 1983 ) .

The most popular bioconjugation technique involves the use of a zero-length crosslinker , 1-ethyl-3- [ 3-dimethylaminopropyl ] carbodiimide hydrochloride ( EDCHCl ) [ 1-4 , 6 , 7 ] , in the presence of a hydrophilic active group , N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide ( sulfo-NHS ) [ 8 ] , for the formation of a stable amide bond between carboxylic acid-functionalized QDs ( QD-COOH ) and any biomolecules containing a primary amine [ 9 ] ( Figure 1 ) .
This method , while proven to yield exclusively QD-protein conjugates in a controlled manner , randomizes the location on a protein to which conjugation can occur , resulting in a non-selective bioconjugation [ 9 ] .

We therefore set out to develop an RT-PCR based method to quantitate CD4 and CD8 mRNA in the hopes that this could be used to predict cell counts .
Although it has long been known that HIV-1 down-regulates CD4 cell surface expression [ 3 , 4 ] , the loss of CD4 is not complete and the HIV-infection does not reduce CD4 mRNA levels [ 5 ] .
Thus , a method based on quantitating CD4 and CD8 mRNA could provide a means of assessing immune status without requiring repetitive and large blood draws , and could be exquisitely sensitive .
This method may also be useful in assessing the immune status of patients retrospectively from archived or frozen samples .

A comparative study of five widely used PCR-based mutagenesis methods identified a modified inverse PCR method as particularly suitable for the deletion of large areas ( > 100 bp ) in malaria parasite genes .
The restriction enzyme-mediated inverse PCR method described here incorporates unique restriction enzyme sites at the 5'-ends of inverse tail-to-tail primers .
The entire gene-containing vector is amplified except the desired region to be deleted and cloned using the unique restriction sites to increase ligation efficiency .
This method was compared in its efficiency to delete a ~400 bp parasite-specific insert in malarial S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase / ornithine decarboxylase ( PfAdoMetDC / ODC ) to existing PCR-based site-directed deletion mutagenesis methods including the QuickChange™ site-directed mutagenesis , ExSite™ , overlapping primer and inverse PCR .

This feature is particularly important in the application of PCR on A+T-rich P. falciparum genes .
This method produced four out of five correct mutated products for a large area ( 411 bp ) in a large gene ( PfAdoMetDC / ODC , gene size 4257 bp ) .

Although sulpho-NHS-LC-biotin is internalized by IE through the parasite 's novel permeation pathway ( NPP ) , Baumeister et al. [ 14 ] have shown that NPP inhibitors such as furosemide [ 4 , 15 ] prevent the uptake of sulpho-NHS-LC-biotin and subsequently the biotinylation of internal proteins .
However in this study it was not clear whether sulpho-NHS-LC-biotin can efficiently label PESAs .
This study demonstrates that the exposure of intact IEs to sulpho-NHS-LC-biotin in the presence of furosemide and the extraction of labelled proteins by osmotic lysis provides an alternative to traditional radioisotope labelling and detergent-based protein extraction methods .

Even though the above approach may find strong correlations , these may not be very useful for malaria prediction if aberrations from the long term seasonal mean of rainfall are weakly linked to aberrations from the long term seasonal mean of the malaria case series .
In addition , the standard cross-correlation assumes observations are independent , whereas in reality the malaria data are temporally correlated .
Cross-correlation with the seasonality and autocorrelation removed by simple pre-whitening allows for detection of the time lag ( s ) of rainfall preceding malaria , at which divergences from the long term seasonal pattern in rainfall time series show strongest correlation with such divergences in detrended malaria case count time series , while minimizing effects of spurious correlations caused by autocorrelation in the time series .
This method bears some similarity to anomaly analysis , where the cross-correlation of aberrations from the long term seasonal mean of the explanatory variables is correlated with aberrations from the long term seasonal mean of the response variable .

This departure is related to the frequency of the duplicated allele and was used to estimate Ag-ace-1D frequency in An. gambiae populations .
The presence of Ag-ace-1D was investigated by fitting two models to the phenotypic data for each sample independently : i ) a two-alleles-only model ( ace-1R and ace-1S ) and ii ) a three-allele model , adding the duplicated allele Ag-ace1D .
The frequency of the duplicated allele was estimated from the excess of heterozygotes observed in each sample , assuming that this excess was due exclusively to the presence of Ag-ace-1D [ 6 ] .
This method is not as accurate as a direct identification of genotypes , but the two methods gave highly concordant results for field samples of C. pipiens [ 6 ] .

Addition of salt and an increase in temperature to 30°C causes the ELP portion of the fusion to self-assemble into an insoluble precipitate , allowing it to be easily separated from the remaining soluble components of the cell lysate .
Because the precipitation is limited to the ELP portion of the protein , which is separated from the intein and target by a flexible linker peptide , the activity of the intein and target are not affected .
Intein cleaving then releases the native target from the ELP tag , which can then be easily separated by an additional precipitation step .

As shown in Figure 2C and 3C , these agents effectively blocked constitutive NF-κB activity in this cell line , thereby suggesting the involvement of the PIR pathway .
Because NF-κB has been shown to mediate cellular growth and survival in MCL [ 25 ] , we evaluated whether cells possessing bortezomib-resistant constitutive NF-κB activity would in fact demonstrate a survival advantage in the face of bortezomib treatment .

Most cold research has focused primarily on in vitro or immunohistochemical studies ; in contrast to heat pain , few behavioral assays relating to cold are available .
The hindpaw acetone cooling assay [ 1 , 2 ] has been used to evaluate cold allodynia , but this test is difficult to quantify in terms of the temperature delivered , and it is difficult to separate the mechanical sensation of wetness from the onset of skin cooling .

Furthermore , even if capsaicin excites TRPV1 in itch fibers , the itch sensation may not dominate since itch-mediating fibers comprise only small proportion of C fibers [ 5 ] .
Thus , although capsaicin may activate both pain and itch through TRPV1 receptors in their respective neurons , it is highly likely that capsaicin preferentially activates nociceptive fibers .
However , it should also be noted that repeated and prolonged applications of topical capsaicin are required to effectively reduce itch [ 62 , 63 ] .

Conversely , TNFα treatment of H4 but not H4 IκBα-SR cells inhibited activity of construct Del.1 containing the putative κB consensus binding site and the initial P2-COMT promoter construct ( P < 0.05 for H4 cells and P > 0.05 for H4 IκBα-SR cells ; Figure 5B and 5C ) .
Thus , the region between position -155 and -33 appears to be crucial for TNFα-dependent suppression of P2-COMT activity .

The deepest depth for shared annotation of gene pair JNM1 and KIP2 is 11 .
Thus , the GO annotation correlation for JNM1 and KIP2 for biological process is calculated as ( 11−1 ) / ( 17−1 ) =0.63 .
This is similar to the GO depth correlation in a previous study of Drosophila physical interactions ( Giot et al , 2003 ) , except that the previous study normalized the depth correlation to fall in the range 0-1 .
This method differs from the semantic similarity method ( Lord et al , 2003 ) in two ways : ( 1 ) it weights GO terms by depth , whereas semantic similarity weights terms by frequency ; ( 2 ) it uses the depth of the deepest annotated term , whereas semantic similarity averages over annotations .

One of the major challenges of current biology is therefore to incorporate the molecular details into the description of the dynamics of cellular processes .
We have presented here an approach for bridging the gap between molecular properties and the dynamics of networks of interactions .
It can be applied in general to compute the stochastic dynamics of macromolecular assembly networks and their integration into cellular networks .
This method is based on a binary description of the potential states of the system and a decomposition of the free energy into a combination of a small subset of elementary contributions of the different components .

DNA-protein complexes take full advantage of the conformational properties of DNA by introducing long-range interactions , thus making DNA an active participant in the delivery of the information it encodes .
The mathematical part of the method we have presented has a direct correspondence with a graphical network description , where nodes represent whether or not an element or a property of the component is present , and where the strength of the links between nodes carries information about the effects of these elements on the stability of the complex .
Therefore , our approach accounts for the precise stochastic biochemical dynamics , as shown by the prototype systems considered here , while keeping the simplicity of qualitative methods based on network diagrams .
This methodology thus offers a solid starting point to move from qualitative to quantitative understanding of protein-protein ( Jansen et al , 2003 ) , protein-DNA ( Edwards et al , 2002 ) , and other interaction networks ( Tavazoie et al , 1999 ; Shen-Orr et al , 2002 ) on a genomic scale .

In the first , the required steady-state condition is reduced by detecting the isotope patterns in free intracellular intermediates ( van Winden et al , 2005 ) .
As the pool size of primary metabolites is orders of magnitude smaller than the normally analyzed proteinogenic pool of amino acids , isotopic steady state is reached much faster .
Labeling experiments may thus be shortened from several hours ( multiple cell divisions ) to minutes , although exchange of label with large pools of unlabeled intracellular macromolecules may extend the labeling period to 1-2 h .
This method will also be applicable to complex media , because central intermediates contain information-bearing label but not the normally used amino acids that are imported from the complex components .

However , a more fundamental problem in many cases is the lack of sufficient data , even in noisy form .
These data must be plentiful in the presence as well the absence of the phenotype to enrich the probabilistic model so that the resulting random variables are defined in a meaningful way .
Once we have a sufficiently large number of measurements , then the problem of noise becomes alleviated because the approach is holistic and the deviations from the accurate values will be averaged out .

The maximum-information partition , as defined above , of the whole set , is reflected by the branching of the root , so that the nodes that are directly stemming from the root represent the subsets defined by the maximum-information partition .
Some of these nodes may be leaves , representing a single factor .

Although mechanistic analysis of synergy detects correlations without differentiating between cause and effect , when coupled with additional biological knowledge it is clearly helpful towards inferring responsible pathways .
Analyzing the correlations among multiple contributing factors , such as gene expression levels and SNPs , can provide much needed insight into the structure of the causative factors , including biological mechanisms responsible for disease .
This review summarized recent results on such techniques aiming to quantify the degree of cooperative interactions among such multiple factors , and to properly decompose them into smaller synergistic sets reflecting the structure of these interactions .
This methodology works best in conjunction with approaches that first use optimization methods for searching over subsets to identify potential modules of multiple factors that jointly provide maximum information about the phenotype ( Varadan and Anastassiou , 2006 ) .

Ideker et al ( 2002 ) introduced a framework for identification of active subnetworks , that is , connected regions of the network that show significant changes in expression over a particular subset of the conditions .
This method uses P-values calculated for every measurement in the expression data to derive a statistical score for every candidate subnetwork , and utilizes simulated annealing to search for high-scoring subnetworks .

Because of errors introduced by this conversion and technical limitations inherent to the genome-wide ChIP analysis ( Lee et al , 2002 ; Hwang et al , 2005 ) , rather than focusing on the characterization of individual targets in network clusters , we identified significantly overrepresented gene properties in each network topology cluster .
This was performed using the CDF with error correction ( see Materials and methods ) to determine the probability of finding the observed ( or greater ) overlap between genes with a given property and genes in a topology cluster .
The null hypothesis was that the given property is independent of membership in a topology cluster .
This method of analysis not only provides a measure of confidence in the results , but also broadens the analysis to global trends and therefore is likely to reveal an insight into system level network regulatory function .

For instance , Kulp and Jagalur ( 2006 ) sought to infer the true causal genes using a Bayesian network model constructed from expression correlations detected within the eQTL profiles .
Another powerful approach has been to complement eQTLs with data on physical molecular interactions .
Tu et al ( 2006 ) modeled each eQTL association as a sequence of transcriptional and protein-protein interactions ( PPIs ) that transmits signals from the locus to the affected target .
This method is promising since it prioritizes candidate genes by their network proximity to the affected target gene and also provides a model of the underlying regulatory pathways .

By plotting all pairs of sij values for all pairs of fits , correlations of R=0.69 to 0.93 were observed ( where R is the correlation coefficient ; Figure 3 ) .
Correlation of less than 1.0 is expected , as sensitivity is a local property dependent on actual position in parameter space , which varies from fit to fit , but the mean value of R=0.84 implies significant similarity in sensitive parameters across fits .
We explored this issue further using a more robust but less familiar measure of ‘regional ' sensitivity : where 〈…〉AVG indicates an average over parameter values lying within 102.5-fold above and below the parameter values of the fit .
This method of calculating average local sensitivity has been discussed previously ( Cukier et al , 1973 ; Bentele , 2004 ; Mahdavi , 2007 ) and has two advantages over simple sensitivity : ( i ) it accounts for the possibility that a fit does not precisely hit a nearby minimum due to problems with convergence during SA and ( ii ) it reduces the impact on sensitivity of small but steep irregularities in the landscape of the objective function .

Eleven cells with a total of 1,300 puncta were evaluated for colocalization of pre- and postsynaptic labels .
Significant colocalization was quantified by comparing the observed distribution of PSD95-YFP puncta with distributions of puncta randomly positioned across the dendritic arbor ( see Materials and methods ) .
Because of the high density of presynaptic labeling in retinal cross sections , the colocalization criterion was arbitrarily defined as the lowest threshold that would still produce < 50 % colocalization in the randomized distribution of PSD95-YFP puncta .
This method of defining colocalization produced a mean colocalization of 46 ± 1 % in randomized puncta distributions and 78 ± 4 % in the observed puncta .

It differs from standard PCR approaches in that one of the two primers has its 3 ' end aligned with a putative mutation site , and has its 3'-OH replaced by a blocking group .

Because abasic sites do not generate gross conformational changes in decamers and larger duplexes , it is has been suggested that subtle structural variations are responsible for the large range of stabilities ( 5 ) .
Unfortunately , in previous NMR studies of abasic DNA structure , it has proven difficult to resolve the abasic site itself due to the absence of base protons .
The position of the abasic sugar and the orphan base have been mainly determined by the application of repulsive , ‘non-NOE’ restraints for atom pairs where NOE peaks were not experimentally observed .
This method may not be reliable because the lack of NOE peaks can be due to conformational or motional exchange .

This has been used to supplement the structure determination of abasic DNA by NMR / rMD ( 14 ) and also to rank a wide variety of conformations of abasic DNA ( 15 ) .

The oxidation curves have three phases : lag , propagation , and decomposition .
This method has been used previously by others [ 24-28 ] .

Most studies use omega-6 rich oil , such as corn oil , soy oil , or safflower seed oil .
However , this practice is not completely unbiased as the omega-6 oil competes with omega-3 fatty acids for metabolism .
Given in high enough doses , the omega-6 oils will overwhelm delta-6 desaturase and inhibit the metabolism of the omega-3 fatty acids .
This methodology results in a systematic measurement error , where the omega-3 metabolism in the placebo group may be suppressed .

Total energy expenditure was predicted ( pTEE ) using the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies for overweight and obese adults formulae [ 16 ] which utilises age , height , weight , gender and physical activity based on PAL score .
A ratio of reported energy intake ( rEI ) to pTEE ( rEI : pTEE ) was calculated for each subject at baseline .
The procedure for identifying mis-reporters of energy intake at baseline followed the method of McCrory et al. [ 17 ] where those reporting energy intakes plus or minus 1 SD for the agreement between rEI and pTEE are regarded as physiological implausible .

It is frequently cited that the difference in weight loss between the LoCHO diet and low fat diet was not statistically significant after one year but it should be pointed out that in these studies , participants had the freedom to increase the carbohydrate content of the diet over longer duration and it is reasonable to say that as carbohydrate is added back to the diet , its effectiveness wanes .
For example , in the study by Foster et al. [ 8 ] , there was no significant difference in the urinary ketone levels between the two study groups after 3 months , suggesting inadequate carbohydrate restriction during the later part of the study which would contribute to the similarity in various parameters between the groups .
In addition , the authors of these studies included subjects who had dropped out of the study .

Lateral gene transfer greatly complicates the issue of who descended from whom , because two organisms could appear closely related based on the similarity of some genes but distantly related based on other genes .
The problem is to determine which genes have been faithfully vertically transmitted—from parent cell to offspring—and thus reflect the history of the bacterial cell lineages .
In this issue , Nancy Moran , Emmanuelle Lerat , and Vincent Daubin propose an approach that solves this problem by identifying a set of genes that serve as reliable indicators of the vertical transfer of bacterial cell lineages .
This method has important implications for biologists studying the evolutionary history of organisms by establishing a foundation for charting the evolutionary events , such as lateral gene transfer , that shape the structure and substance of genomes .

Hence , from the standpoint of controlled diversification of reaction specificity , it is beneficial for the recombinase to have evolved a spacer with a high degree of sequence heterogeneity , while maintaining intimate contact with the spacer nucleotides via analog interactions .
The complex multiplier effect of analog contacts throughout the length of the RSS , superimposed onto specific digital contacts in the heptamer and nonamer , therefore confers upon the recombinase the critical ability to distinguish between inappropriate sites that happen to contain the requisite absolutely conserved nucleotides ( e.g. , the Jβ2.6 RSS ) versus true binding sites whose sequences diverge markedly from the consensus ( e.g. , most endogenous RSSs ) .
RIC scores provide a powerful tool for the prediction of RSS quality based on nucleotide sequence .

However , it was not known whether these elements are conserved in more distantly related species for which the intergenic regions can not be aligned .
To explore this possibility , we reasoned that many genes that are coregulated in S. cerevisiae should also be coregulated in other fungal species , and that functional cis-regulatory elements could be identified with the same methods applied to coregulated S. cerevisiae genes .
Therefore , for each group of coregulated S. cerevisiae genes , we identified orthologs in each of 13 other fungal genomes using the method of Wall et al. ( 2003 ) .
This method identifies reciprocal BLAST hits between two genomes that span more than 80 % of the protein lengths , thereby providing a more conservative list of putative orthologs than a simple BLAST method .

In conclusion , integrinα5 expression in the pharyngeal endoderm is in a pattern that both spatially and temporally corresponds to regions of pouch formation , and expression of integrinα5 in the crest begins during premigratory stages and later becomes refined to patches of crest derivatives within the pharyngeal arches .
As integrinα5 expression was observed in both pharyngeal endoderm and neural crest , we used transplantation experiments to determine in which tissues Integrinα5 was required for first pouch and hyoid cartilage development ( Figure 4 ) .
Since it is difficult to transplant large amounts of endoderm from normal zebrafish embryos , we used forced expression of the activated Taram-A receptor ( TAR* ) to generate donor embryos consisting almost entirely of endoderm ( see David et al. [ 2002 ] for details ) .
This method allows the specific and unilateral introduction of large amounts of endoderm into mutant hosts .

However , such overlap can have a substantial impact during the discovery phase ( i.e. , in an incompletely sampled group ) , as the status of unknowns that fall outside the coalescent of previously sampled species is problematic to evaluate .
The proposed mechanism for the evaluation of unknowns within a partially sampled phylogeny is through the implementation of thresholds , chosen to separate intraspecific variation from interspecific differences .

They looked for genes whose expression in the high sigma E activity strain differed most from genes in the low sigma E activity strain , and then searched upstream of these genes for promoters containing these sigma sites ( the region to which the transcription machinery binds ) .

Second , this method can not detect any activity that is associated with shifts of attention to both left and right locations , because such spatially nonspecific activity is subtracted away .
If , for example , activity in the right parietal lobe controls shifts of attention to both left and right visual fields [ 27 ] , then that activity would go undetected .
To better isolate activity related to the control of attention shifts , researchers have begun to compare activity associated with the presentation of attend cues to activity associated with the presentation of neutral cues that either provide no information about the location of the impending target ( i.e. , noninformative cues ) [ 6 ] or signify that the target will not occur ( i.e. , interpret cues ) [ 4 , 14 , 28 ] .

The hierarchical prediction algorithm allows us to quickly prune the conformational space and focus sampling on energetically favorable regions of conformation space ( Figure 2 ) .
Unlike Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics sampling schemes , the algorithm itself has no knowledge of the starting conformation of the loop .
The entire conformational space of the loop is sampled with varying sampling resolution in a hierarchical manner .
This method has proven successful in recreating crystallographic conformations of unphosphorylated loops to loop lengths of 12 residues .

We refer to this test as “loop prediction.” In this test , sampling only the conformation of the loop itself ( Table 5 , “loop only” ) is successful in some cases , such as histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein ( HPr ) , in which the conformational changes upon phosphorylation are small .
In other cases , this strategy performs poorly because the phosphorylation induces substantial conformational changes in the surroundings of the loop , as discussed for CDK2 above .
In order to capture these essential structural rearrangements in the region surrounding the loop , we also optimize the conformations of all side chains that have at least one atom within 4.5 Å of the loop , as described in Materials and Methods .
This method permits all cases , excepting extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 ( ERK2 ) , to be predicted with near-atomic accuracy , especially the phosphate group itself .

LOH inferences using only tumor samples agree well with LOH patterns determined by analysis of tumor / normal pairs in two different array types ( 10 K and 100 K ) , three different tissue types ( lung , glioma , and prostate ) , and in both cell lines and tumors , in test and in validation datasets .
The inferences are robust to model parameter specifications .
LOH is resolved to about 3 Mb or 100 SNPs in 100 K array data .
This method makes it feasible to use SNP array technology to map LOH in tumor samples for which normal DNA is unavailable .


./PLoS_Comput_Biol/PLoS_Comput_Biol-2-5-1464804.nxml.sentences
The HMM approach can also be used to infer LOH probabilities for paired normal and tumor samples ( see Protocol S1 ) , unifying the LOH analysis for paired tumor / normal and unpaired tumor samples .
At higher SNP densities , where the haplotype structure of the human genome becomes relevant , an approach that considers the dependence among multiple SNPs in a region of LD is necessary in addition to the LD-HMM .
We used a haplotype correction that compared regions of inferred putative LOH to a set of reference normal samples to reduced false LOH inference .
This method works best if the reference samples have similar haplotypes to the tumor sample .

Distinguishing clearly between truly dynamic features and random fluctuations of a network remains a challenge .
The SPL combines information on global topological organization with the connective structure of the network and relative abundances of local subgraphs , data which are all proven powerful tools for annotating gene expression data [ 29 ] , inferring network mechanisms [ 30 ] , and classifying networks into families [ 31 ] .
The figurative representation of SPLs ( e.g. , Figure 1 ) is also a visualization of the inner structures of a regulatory network which could be used to obtain a clearer picture of network activity .
This method for network subgraph analysis might also be applied to other biological or non-biological networks , such as metabolic networks , neuronal circuits , or electronic chips .

This information is then used to identify the group of TFs ( KG ) that is most widely acting and most densely interacting , and the two growth environments ( representing a growth environment shift ) in which this occurs .
The resulting combination of KG and growth environment shift is then considered the experiment design with the greatest potential for providing the most new regulatory rules .
This presumption is based on the power law nature of TRNs [ 17 , 18 ] , which implies that more highly connected TFs are more likely to be involved in undiscovered regulatory interactions .
This methodology has the added advantage of ( dis ) confirming rules already in the model , but this becomes less of an issue as subsequent iterations utilize more speculative information in place of rules in the model as a basis for suggesting experiment designs .

Watson-Crick hybridization occurs between the 3′-terminal , single-stranded nucleotides of the 16S rRNA ( the rRNA tail ) and the SD sequence in the mRNA and has a significant effect on translation [ 3 , 4 ] .
The formation of hydrogen bonds between aligned , complementary nucleotides is the basis of Watson-Crick hybridization and results in a more stable , double-stranded structure with lower free energy than the participating single-stranded sequences .
One long-standing implementation of this model , Mfold [ 11 ] , quantifies the degree of hybridization and the stability of RNA secondary structure by calculating the change in energy ( ΔG ° ) [ 12-14 ] .
This method for estimating free energy has been adapted to identify SD sequences by repeatedly calculating the ΔG ° values for progressive alignments of the rRNA tail with the mRNA in the region upstream of the start codon [ 5 , 6 , 15 , 16 ] .


./PLoS_Comput_Biol/PLoS_Comput_Biol-2-5-1464815.nxml.sentences
For each gene in each organism , we predicted the change in the free energy , ΔG ° , required to bring the two strands of nucleotides together and to form a double helix structure using free-scan , a program we wrote .
In the absence of catalytic enzymes , chemical reactions with ΔG ° values greater than zero require additional energy from an external source and are unlikely to occur spontaneously .
On the other hand , reactions with ΔG ° values less than zero are likely to take place .
This method has been used in many studies of SD sequences [ 6 , 9 , 15 , 16 , 47-49 ] , as well as in the genome annotation program GLIMMER [ 29 ] .

Essential genes .
A novel method , transposon site hybridization , was implemented and applied to determine essential genes in M. tuberculosis under nutrient-rich conditions [ 8 , 20 ] .
Briefly , this procedure involved two steps : ( 1 ) random disruption of genes by transposon mutagenesis to generate growth mutants , and ( 2 ) competitive hybridization between insertion and gene probes to identify mutants that could not survive in nutrient-rich media .
This method predicted 614 genes essential for growth in vitro , but with a predicted 1 % false discovery rate [ 8 ] .

Individual LLSs are then added together to compute an overall integrated LLS for the interaction ( the so-called “naive” Bayesian approach ) ; this combination of evidence types into a common probabilistic measure eliminates the need for discretization ( applying a p-value threshold ) and accounts for the relative predictive power among the input data types .
Given a method for assessing interaction reliability , we also sought to organize high-confidence interactions into TF modules ( i.e. , sets of TFs that cooperatively regulate sets of genes ) .
For this purpose , we applied an algorithm that identified all TF combinations regulating common targets and assigned p-values of significance to these overlaps [ 26 ] .
This method of module identification is scalable to much larger datasets , which will be particularly necessary in view of the complex transcriptional regulation observed in higher eukaryotes [ 8 ] .

Genome-scale metabolic network models can be reconstructed for well-characterized organisms using genomic annotation and literature information .
However , there are many instances in which model predictions of metabolic fluxes are not entirely consistent with experimental data , indicating that the reactions in the model do not match the active reactions in the in vivo system .
We introduce a method for determining the active reactions in a genome-scale metabolic network based on a limited number of experimentally measured fluxes .
This method , called optimal metabolic network identification ( OMNI ) , allows efficient identification of the set of reactions that results in the best agreement between in silico predicted and experimentally measured flux distributions .

Our method finds functional relationships that are not detectable by the conventional presence-absence profile comparisons , and it does not require a priori any fixed criteria to define orthologous genes .
The vast number of protein sequences being determined by the international genomics projects means that it is not possible to functionally characterise all the proteins through direct experimentation .
One of the more successful electronic methods for detecting functionally associated genes has been through the comparison of genes ' phylogenetic profiles .

Such scans typically find on the order of hundreds of thousands to millions of hairpins , depending on genome size and search parameters [ 4 ] ( plus our own unpublished data ) .
This high number is then reduced by only keeping hairpins that are conserved in other species .
Another approach is to search only transcribed sequences in the form of expressed sequence tags [ 7 , 8 ] .
This method works for nonsequenced genomes and efficiently reduces the search space , probably leading to a lower number of false positives , but the method also misses candidates not covered by the expressed sequence tag libraries .

These results indicate that a significant number of the SNPs in dbSNP have large estimated variances , which would not provide enough precise information for designing studies requiring the accurate estimation of SNP HET rates ( i.e. , those using SNPs for LOH detection for molecular diagnoses ) .
Traditionally , for diallelic alleles with p1 and p2 allele frequencies , the HET rate could be estimated as hr = 2p1p2 , although this formula is appropriate only for alleles in HWE .
Another approach , which is robust to HWE assumptions , is to estimate the HET rate ( and its variance ) directly by population allele frequencies [ 16 ] .
This method requires large sample sizes in order to achieve accurate estimation of HET rates .

Table 2 utilizes a fixed sample size method that is easy to use , but may not be optimal when considering the number of subjects needed .
A sequential sampling technique based on the sequential probability ratio test ( SPRT ) [ 17 ] can be used for directly inferring SNP heterozygous rates .
With this method , samples are tested one by one and a decision will be made to determine whether or not the HET rate of a SNP has reached a prespecified value after each sample is tested .

Each gene expression profile is preprocessed by z-score transformation , which equalizes the scale of variation between genes and centers each profile on zero .
Each gene expression profile is correlated to a series of cosine curves generated with a phase shift t equal to the interval between sample collection points ( 4 h for most datasets ) .
The phase tmax that produces the highest correlation is considered the most likely phase for the gene x .

Possible mechanisms of desensitization in the Jak / Stat3 pathway include receptor downregulation , SHP2- or SOCS3-mediated signal attenuation , and differential transport kinetics of STAT3 , but the relative importance of each interaction is unknown .
As a first step to investigate this response , model-predicted trends of desensitization ( Figure 6A ) were experimentally verified ( Figure 6B ) , and showed that a minimum time of about 3 h is required after ligand stimulation for the cells to become fully responsive to the readdition of LIF .
GSA of two successive Stat3 activation profiles was used to understand what pathway components control desensitization .
This method distinguishes between desensitization and inhibition , since both successive activation profiles will be changed by inhibition , but only the reactivation profile is influenced by desensitization .

Analysis of TEs in the human genome revealed ∼600,000 examples where TEs have transposed into and fragmented other TEs , covering > 40 % of all TEs or ∼542 Mbp of genomic sequence .
The relative age of these TEs over evolutionary time is implicit in their organization , because newer TEs have necessarily transposed into older TEs that were already present .
A matrix of the number of times that each TE has transposed into every other TE was constructed , and a novel objective function was developed that derived the chronological order and relative ages of human TEs spanning > 100 million years .
This method has been used to infer the relative ages across all four major TE classes , including the oldest , most diverged elements .


./PLoS_Comput_Biol/PLoS_Comput_Biol-3-7-1933472.nxml.sentences
Therefore , a novel method to estimate the age of TEs was developed based on the fact that as TEs spread throughout the genome , they inserted into and fragmented older TEs that were already present .
Therefore , the age of TEs can be revealed by how often they have been fragmented over evolutionary time .
We performed a genome-wide defragmention of TEs , and developed a novel objective function to derive the chronological order of TEs spanning > 100 million years .

Our method to determine relative ages of TEs is not dependent on the percent divergence from derived consensus sequences or on an assumption of a constant molecular clock , and hence can be applied to all TEs in a given genome that have interacted with ( inserted into or been interrupted by ) enough TEs .
Furthermore , this analysis is independent of the actual DNA sequence of the elements .
Hence , the relative ages are determined across different classes and subfamilies of TEs .
This method is as applicable to the older elements as it is to the younger elements .

In these cases , the depth of field of the objective ( i.e. , the vertical distance from which information can be captured ) may be important [ 10 ] .
When associations between nucleus compartments are of interest , it has been argued by Jacobs and colleagues that constraining the analysis to two dimensions actually makes statistical tests more stringent , since random ( expected ) colocalisations will be less frequent if the foci are given more room to roam , and will lower the threshold of the significance [ 10 ] .
Otherwise , meaningful results have been obtained by studying distribution patterns in flattened 2D cell nuclei [ 11 , 12 ] .
This method can not be used to calculate absolute distances because of the disruptive effects of the cell preparation method on cell nucleus topology , but is generally considered sufficient for statistical analysis of relative distance measurements .

One example of this utilises a distance-based approach , with the rationale that non-uniform positioning of a compartment will be revealed by non-uniform distributions of experimental intercompartment distances compared with those calculated for a uniform simulated distribution [ 19 ] .
This approach has been successfully applied to chromosome territories by basing homologue separation distances on the distances between the centres of homologous chromosome territories [ 19 , 20 , 33 ] , satellite DNA sequences [ 28 , 34 ] , genomic loci in Drosophila cell nuclei [ 11 ] , and Barr bodies in human fibroblasts [ 35 ] .
It is also possible to quantify relative spatial proximity in terms of orbital arrangement using the angle formed between compartments and the nuclear centre .
This method was originally used to study the positions of chromosomes on prometaphase chromosome rosettes [ 19 , 36 ] and has been used more recently in interphase cells [ 20 ] , where the wide range of angles measured between homologous chromosomes argued against the existence of a highly ordered orbital arrangement of chromosomes .

As such , any given nucleus has a unique DNA imaging pattern and a unique set of spatial probability for radiation-induced DSB .
Therefore , we can not directly predict the DSB patterns in real images and compare their spatial distributions to RIF using a theoretical model of the nucleus .
To answer such need , we introduce here an imaging methodology that can predict DSB location for any given DNA nuclear pattern from real images .
This methodology is based on the same Monte Carlo concepts described in Materials and Methods for the generation of DSBs in artificial nuclei : i.e. , the probability of a DSB at a given location is proportional to the DNA density at the same location .

Thus all the sequences are converted to a new version of the sequence , where all the sequences are of equal length , and the bases that can be optimally aligned to the consensus ( therefore conserved in most monomers ) are readjusted to the same location within the sequence .
As stated above , we only count the number of substitutions during the Hamming distance computation , and indels are not penalized .
Any bases inserted in a monomer but not present in the consensus ( thus a specific insertion for that monomer ) would induce gaps to the other monomer when pairwise alignments are performed .
This method of normalizing the sequences precipitates the removal of such bases inserted in a monomer that would not be counted in any case , while aligning the conserved regions ( along with substituted bases ) to the same coordinates .

In our implementation , the initial choice of the intensity threshold at which to draw the cell outline is arbitrary , but the threshold value is then optimized to yield the contour for which the intensity change between the cell and the background is most drastic .
This is accomplished by finding the threshold where the total area enclosed by the contour is the least sensitive to small changes in the threshold value .
The contours chosen in this manner agree well with methods that require calibration of the images against a membrane dye [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , and have the added advantage that they do not require system-specific calibration .
This method for choosing the intensity threshold at which to draw the contour has the additional advantages of not relying on any global parameters of the image and of being insensitive to the contrast between the cell and the background .

Though the solution of such a problem needs further development for its scalability to large-scale systems [ 64 ] , it may shed light on whether signal transduction at the current time step is optimally driven by a long-term objective .
Currently , multi-stage optimization problems have been solved only for metabolic systems [ 25 ] .
Recently , a method called Biological Objective Solution Search ( BOSS ) was developed for the inference of an objective function for a biological system from its underlying network stoichiometry as well as experimentally-measured flux distributions [ 54 ] .
This method identifies objectives from experimental fluxes by defining a putative stoichiometric objective reaction , adding this reaction to the existing set of stoichiometric constraints , and maximizing it via linear programming .

This feature extraction method has subsequently been used , as will be described here , to extract possible glycan features that may serve as biomarkers .
More details on feature extraction for computational biology can be found in the literature [ 25 ] .
In glycome informatics , the layered-trimer kernel was first developed and used to verify the utility of using kernels for glycan biomarker prediction [ 26 ] .
This method was further expanded as the q-gram distribution kernel [ 27 ] , and a separate method combining multiple kernels was later used for glycan structure classification [ 28 ] .

The weighting parameter wk is set to 1 when the layer of feature k is 1 .
Otherwise , wk = 1−exp ( −αh ) , where α is a positive constant to weight h , the layer of the matching substructures .
Using this kernel on the leukemia dataset described above , the model was able to extract a feature that was highly characteristic of leukemia , which was corroborated by experimental evidence .
This method extended the layered-trimer kernel in order to account for potential glycan biomarkers that were smaller or larger than trimers , without the use of layers , since it was assumed that layer information could be subsumed by the wider distribution of features .

In this method , the concept of a “co-occurrence score” was calculated based on the co-occurrence of pairs of links within the same glycan structures .
It was expected that by doing so the substrate specificity of glycosyltransferases could be captured in a single numerical matrix .
Once this co-occurrence score matrix was developed , it could be used to make predictions from expression data .
This method was further improved such that ( i ) the database of glycans were augmented with new glycans that should exist and ( ii ) the prediction score for glycans used the expression values directly as opposed to using binary values .

This alignment is essential since the algorithm underlying the pan-specific binding predictions relies on the ability to capture general features of the relationship between peptides and HLA sequences and interpret these in terms of a binding affinity .
Such relationships can only by captured if the peptide is correctly aligned relative to the residues in the HLA binding cleft .
We have recently published a method [ 26 ] for prediction of peptide-MHC class II binding that covers the 14 HLA-DR alleles which are populated with large amounts of quantitative peptide data in the IEDB database .
This method provides a predicted binding affinity value for each peptide , together with an identification of the peptide-binding core , and it is based upon these predictions , we have developed this HLA-DR pan-specific method following the strategy described in [ 3 ] .

It should be noted , however , that sequence conservation per se does not necessarily imply functionality and may reflect variation in the mutation rate [ 15 ] .
One means of accounting for the effects of varying mutation rate involves calibration of the nucleotide substitution rate in putatively functional regions with that in a nearby sequence which is assumed to be evolving neutrally .
This approach enables estimation of selective constraint , defined as the proportion of new mutations occurring at a locus which is strongly deleterious and removed by purifying selection [ 16 ] , and of the rate of deleterious mutation , an important parameter in population genetics .
This method has been previously employed , both to estimate the extent of purifying selection [ 2 ] and the genomic deleterious mutation rate in mammalian coding and noncoding DNA [ 17 , 18 ] .

This amounted to 188,600,000 simulated case control calculations for each disease model examined ( multiplicative and additive ) .
Using the above power estimates , for each genotyped SNP or SNP tagged at r2 = 1 , we assigned it a power value according to its minor allele frequency for each disease model and study design ( i.e. , number of cases and controls ) .
This allows us to do a single power estimation for each of the possible minor allele frequencies ( 5 % -50 % in increments of 1 % ) rather than doing an individual calculation for all possible ∼2.2 million common SNPs .

We estimated the average human-Neanderthal DNA sequence divergence time , the modern European-Neanderthal population split time , and the Neanderthal contribution to modern European ancestry using methodology very similar to what was used by Noonan et al. [ 1 ] .
This method is based on a simple population model of isolation followed by instantaneous admixture ( see Materials and Methods ) , and utilizes information from each base pair about whether the human reference sequence and/or the Neanderthal sequence have the derived ( or ancestral ) allele to estimate parameters .

However , the heterozygotes ( R / S ) and the genotypes involving a duplicated haplotype ( heterozygotes : ( D / S ) and ( D / R ) and homozygotes : ( D / D ) ) can not be distinguished ( they all display a [ RS ] phenotype ) .
Moreover , this test does not allow distinction between the two duplicated haplotypes D2 and D3 .
The pooled frequency of D2 and D3 can be estimated from the apparent excess of [ RS ] phenotypes caused by the presence of the duplications [ 26 ] .
This method assumes Hardy-Weinberg proportions for the different genotypes and is therefore not as accurate as direct observation of the different genotypes .

Briefly , the systematic hybrid LOH method utilizes a set of 16 strains , each containing a conditional centromere construct on one of the 16 yeast chromosomes .
Mating each gene deletion strain to the appropriate conditional centromere strain creates hybrid diploids that are transiently heterozygous for the gene deletion .
After chromosome loss is induced for the conditional chromosome , homozygosis of the marked gene deletion occurs more than 95 % of the time as a result of endoduplication of the monosomic chromosome .
This method allows the introduction of any plasmid or chromosomal construct into individual mutants of the gene deletion library through mating rather than individual transformations .

It has been shown that an effective separation of nuclear and mitochondrial substitutions can be achieved by counting only unique substitutions as nuclear [ 5 , 35 ] .
This is based on the reasoning that , in relatively undiverged sequences , nucleotide differences that are shared by two or more Numts are more likely to be the result of common ancestry than of multiple independent mutations .
Since many Numts were derived independently from divergent mitochondrial ancestors [ 59 ] , many of these shared differences probably arose in the mitochondria .
This method for distinguishing nuclear and mitochondrial mutations is similar in effect to a maximum parsimony approach ( e.g. , [ 9 ] ) .

Given the very small number of double-COs , it seems likely that many more plants would be needed to detect any possible coincidence variation .
Another way of analyzing interference is to plot coincidence between one fixed interval and a series of increasingly distant intervals ( four-point coincidence : C4 ; [ 27 ] ) .

We then used the ABC method , which generates posterior distributions of the parameters of interest deduced from parameter values of simulations satisfying the D ( S′ , S ) < ξ criterion ( see previous section and [ 37 ] for more details ) , with ξ chosen so that only 5,000 of 250,000 simulations are retained [ 17 ] .
For the ABC procedure , we used the following summary statistics : S , π , Tajima 's D , Fu & Li 's D* for each population group and pairwise FST and for each pair of population groups .
This method was demonstrated to be accurate by estimating IM parameters for 100 simulated datasets for which the IM parameters were specified .

We also created inferred haplotype datasets by phasing pseudo-individuals ( piCHMs ) that were created by randomly pairing the CHM haplotypes .
Haplotypes of chromosome 6p was inferred by PHASE ( v2.1 ) using the default settings , after dividing the region into 25 non-overlapping segments , each with 500 SNPs .
Neighboring segments of PHASEd-piCHM haplotypes were linked by referring to the phases of CHM at heterozygous sites that were nearest to the segment ends .
This method of segment phasing is not as strict as that employed in PHASElink [ 9 ] .

In order to determine if this increase in tissue specificity was particular to a tissue , we developed a method to find the tissue ( or few tissues ) for which the expression of the gene was specific .
We can not assume that the expression levels are normally distributed , thus we determined the median and the inter-quartile range ( IQR ) of the expression for each gene in the whole dataset with obtainable expression data ( 3,133 genes ) .
Tissues were accepted as specific for a gene if they exhibited expression greater than or equal to the median expression plus 7.5 IQRs .
This method allows us to capture multiple tissues in which expression is relatively high , irrespective of overall expression level , as well as controlling for the distribution of expression values ( e.g. taking as a cut-off value a multiple of the average will suffer from genes with large IQR ) .

These models assume that there is an underlying normally distributed “liability” trait , with a threshold level above which the disease is manifested .
These took three forms .
First ( method 3 ) , we compared the incidence of malaria admissions to hospital among affected full-sibs to that in the general , unrelated , population : a difference in incidence among relatives reflects a genetic component in the trait on the underlying scale and thus allows an estimation of its heritability [ 13 ] .
This method does not allow for incorporation of fixed effects into the analysis , or for separation of h2 from c2 , but does provide an easy way of calculating an upper limit to heritability from incidence data .

Finally , they are informed that debriefing will occur .
One possible objection to the technique of authorized deception is that it is liable to defeat the purpose of using deception to obviate potentially biased responses of research participants to research interventions .
Informing participants that deception will occur ( particularly in a study that involves administration of a placebo ) is apt to make them suspicious and wary , thus possibly contributing to biased data .
This methodological risk is avoided in most deceptive research , which does not employ this technique , provided that prospective participants do not otherwise suspect that deception will be used .

Consequently , education for health professionals should explain that while knowledge of misleading promotional techniques may help them avoid being misled sometimes , there is no proven method for enabling them to gain more benefit than harm from exposure to pharmaceutical promotion .
People who are confident in their ability to distinguish justified from unjustified promotional messages may be operating under an illusion , as many influence techniques are very difficult for humans to evaluate and there are no proven methods for sorting them .
One method for reducing such overconfidence is to first expose participants to a single example of misleading drug or device promotion , allow them to express unjustified beliefs , debunk those beliefs , and then finally explain the misleading techniques that were used .
This method enables participants to understand that they are personally vulnerable to being misled by promotion [ 18 , 27 ] .

We carried out 20 cycles of regression switching , and generated ten imputation datasets .
This approach creates a number of copies of the data ( in this case we generated ten copies ) each of which has values that are missing imputed with an appropriate level of randomness using chained equations [ 24 ] .

The assay shows an excellent linearity between the log of the number of siRNA copies and the cycle threshold ( CT ) value , with a dynamic range of at least 7 logs .
This method is sensitive enough to detect 10,000 siRNA molecules ( Figure 4A ) .

For Hipp9a the interval was 24.5 Mb for the BXDs , 21.5 Mb for the AILs , and only 14.5 Mb for the composite map-an average improvement of 37 % over the individual mapping efforts .
We have developed and implemented a simple method for combining QTL mapping results from multiple QTL experiments .
The ready availability of dense marker maps and physical positions as well as genetic positions for markers facilitates incorporation of positional information .
This method can therefore be used not only to report combined probability of the existence of a QTL locus more accurately than simply combining the best P-values for multiple mapping approaches [ 6 ] .

For instance , directly combining more than one QTL map from the same RI or congenic population is problematic .
Instead it might be practical to combine the data gathered on the population as appropriate and generate a single QTL map from the combined data .
This map could then be combined with any other independent mapping experiments using our method .
This method can be extended to incorporate data from a variety of data sources , including congenic and consomic data .

After removal of host white blood cells using a CF11 column , 2 ml of packed infected Red blood cells ( IRBC ) were divided as follows : 1 ml was cryopreserved in glycerolyte , 200 µl spotted onto a filter paper and 800 µl was used for the in vitro drug susceptibility assay .
Patients were treated with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine ( Indonesia ) or chloroquine ( Thailand ) according to local guidelines , but were not followed routinely thereafter .
P. vivax susceptibility to chloroquine was measured at both sites using an identical protocol modified from the WHO microtest as described previously [ 17 ] .
This method was modified further by reducing the final haematocrit of the blood media mix ( BMM ) from 4 % to 2 % ; and using 200 µl of BMM per well instead of 50 µl .

All Len proteins bear at least some hallmarks of being lipoproteins , with LenA , LenB , LenC , LenD and LenF having high probabilities of being so according to analyses using the spirochete-specific lipoprotein algorithm SpLip [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] .
Using the above-described anti-LenD antiserum , cellular localization of that protein was assessed by Triton X-114 detergent solubilization and phase partitioning of live leptospires .
The reliability of this technique has been validated by comparisons with results obtained by sucrose density gradient isolation of outer membrane vesicles [ 19 ] .
This method yields three fractions : a detergent fraction consisting of outer membrane components , an aqueous fraction consisting of periplasmic contents , and a pellet consisting of inner membrane-associated components , cytoplasmic contents , and undisrupted cells [ 20 ] .

Several standard clustering methods were evaluated using a range of cluster numbers from 25 to 500 including the expression values calculated from all MG1655 specific probe sets .
We then tested whether a cluster contained more of a particular biological relationship than would be expected by random chance using the hypergeometric distribution with a modified Bonferroni correction as implemented in GeneMerge [ 25 ] .
Based on this test , we chose to present the K-means clustering results using Euclidean distance metrics and a relatively small number ( 50 ) of clusters .
This method grouped together the previously identified SoxS-regulated genes , and did not include a cluster containing RpoH-regulated genes which are likely to be the result of secondary regulation mediated by SoxS through RpoH ( see below ) .

The MHW method is extensively described in the Methods section and schematically depicted in Figure 2 .
This method ignores direct effects from climate ( e.g. , AD and ITCZ ) on disease TS .
Nevertheless , MHW-based historical TS analyses can obliquely capture non-linear prior interactions between climate and the aforementioned disease dynamics thus , potentially obviating the need for more complex disease-specific climate-based parametric forecasting methods ( which are otherwise indispensable for highly-unstable transmission and or spatially-extended infectious disease models ) in the district of Niono .
This method could directly improve infectious disease management in this district with potential repercussions elsewhere in the Sahel where quantitative approaches may assist with predicting and containing infectious disease-induced morbidity and mortality .

Bite force in Nigersaurus , we must conclude , must have been reduced compared to other sauropods including Diplodocus .
The skull of Nigersaurus presents an excellent case to test the utility of finite-element modeling of cranial form [ 28 ] .

We performed cross-sample comparisons of gene expression profiles using a newly developed , glycan-focused cDNA microarray .
Cell-surface glycan expression profiles were obtained using flow cytometry of cells stained with plant lectins .
Pearson 's correlation coefficients were calculated for these profiles and were used to identify enzyme genes correlated with glycan biosynthesis .
This method , designated correlation index-based responsible-enzyme gene screening ( CIRES ) , successfully identified genes already known to be involved in the biosynthesis of certain glycans .

All cells were cultured under commonly used conditions and were used in logarithmic growth phase .
Under these conditions , the glycan expression phenotype obtained by lectin staining tended to be uniform within a cell line and unique for each cell line .
Thus , the data obtained by lectin staining with excess probe were suitable for determining the mean fluorescence intensity ( MFI ) of lectin staining .
This method compared the relative glycan expression profiles of cell lines whose cellular size and character might not be uniform ; therefore , we normalized the staining signal by using the ratio of the stained sample MFI to the control MFI .

These SNPs were entered in the hidden Markov model ( HMM ) to estimate the marker locus specific ancestry in African-Americans based on EM algorithm using software ADMIXPROGRAM [ 25 ] .
The genome-wide admixture mapping analysis was only performed in African-Americans since the SNP set of Smith et al. was specifically selected for the African-American population .
We estimated marker location-specific ancestry using the HMM , in which the transmission probability was calculated based on the continuous gene flow ( CGF ) model [ 21 ] , [ 25 ] .
This method directly maximizes the likelihood function through an EM iterative algorithm and allows consideration of uncertainty of marker allele frequencies in the parental populations [ 25 ] .

In this manuscript , we describe the immunological properties of a new peptide whose amino acid sequence was deduced from the complementary ( antisense ) DNA strand to the sense DNA strand encoding the A1 peptide , which we called a complementary A1 peptide or cA1 peptide ( VHNQLVLRRLAPSVPVVLLF ) .
It should be noted that according to the RRM concept the A1 and B1 peptides could be considered as interacting pair of peptides because they exhibit the opposite phases at predicted common frequencies established for the viral CD4 binding fragments of the HIV-1 isolates [ 34 ] .
Thus , the “antisense” cA1 peptide was a candidate for an antigenic homolog of both B1 peptide and gp120 envelop proteins of HIV-1 .
This method was used to induce cellular immunity against HIV-1 and was validated in immunized rabbits as well as in T lymphocytes originated from HIV-1 infected and envelope-immunized individuals .

At the largest scanning window size ( 1 km ) , there are very few cases detected using either of the spatial resolutions , due to the convergence of the cluster grid and overall detection region .
The speed of detection ( i.e. detection timeliness ) is one of the most important performance measures for disease surveillance .
In the space-time permutation scan statistic , the time window is varied at time spans ranging from one month to six months and anchored on the last month of the time window , using data restricted up to that point .
This methodology provides a pseudo-real time scan , prospectively , where it is assumed that data is only available up to the point of running the space-time permutation scan statistic .

An appropriate choice for the λ values should be a good compromise between too little ( λ = 0 , overfitting ) or too much filtering ( λ large ) , and earlier research [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] suggest that appropriate values lie at the corner of the so-called L-curve plot that displays the log ( ||Σ x−b|| ) vs. log ( ||x|| ) .
While this method provides automatic selection for the regularization parameters , it is not clear what would be an appropriate choice for the column vector b and to what extent the optimization obtained for this inverse problem yields optimal results for the classification problem .
We describe a new way of performing the regularization step that allows us to select a parameter in such a way that it improves the generalization , by looking for minimization of class errors not only for the self-class , but also for other classes and in-between classes .

The general principle of these studies is to search for a distortion of the transmission of alleles from parents to affected offspring , by means of the “transmission disequilibrium test” ( TDT ) [ 51 ] .
Families with one missing parent ( 30 / 84 in our sample ) can be analysed either by reconstructing parental genotypes from children ( RC-TDT ) [ 52 ] , or by using unaffected siblings as controls ( Sib-TDT ) [ 53 ] .
The family-based association study was carried out mainly according to the method implemented in the FBAT program [ 54 ] , which combines these three different methods ( TDT , RC-TDT , and Sib-TDT ) .

Photon shot noise was the dominant source of noise in the optical trace : the cumulative photon count at resting voltage was only 4500 photons per 100 µs sample .
Accurate measurement of the rate of dye bleaching was precluded by systematic effects such as tissue movement , dye diffusion and slow laser noise ; we conservatively estimate it to be less than 30 % after one hour of continuous full-frame scanning at the maximum excitation power available to us .
Such a low rate of photobleaching suggests that a significant improvement in fluorescence yield could be achieved with a more powerful laser .
This method of measuring transmembrane voltage therefore holds the promise of reaching signal-to-noise ratios comparable to those achieved with quiet cameras and widefield illumination [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] while benefiting from all the advantages of two-photon excitation : the ability to see much deeper into tissue than with widefield single-photon excitation ( Figure 3d ) , as well as relative insensitivity to tissue autofluorescence and out-of-focus labeling resulting from the optical sectioning inherent in non-linear absorption .

Withdrawn synapses do not produce physiological effects onto their targets , nor do they continue to undergo STDP .
They do , however , continue to decay in “strength” through the homosynaptic depression .
Since the axon withdrawal is reversible—if one of the supersynapses dips below ΘS—continuing to track the strength is a way for the system to have some memory of its past configuration , though that memory should fade in time if the neuron remains saturated for a long time .
This method was chosen because withdrawals in the network occur instantaneously rather than through a more realistic gradual process .

As selection against σ70 sites in the nonfunctional DNA appears to be mostly absent from species with intermediate growth rates , we also analyzed separately the subset of slow and fast growers where this selection is actually detected ( NSD < −2 , below the red line ) .
When only such genomes are included , the correlation between the degree of deviation in nonfunctional DNA and the number of tRNA genes increases ( r = 0.63 and p < 0.001 , solid line in Fig. 5 ) .
In order to ensure that the obtained correlations are not due to phylogenetic relatedness , we employed a method that takes into account the topology and branch lengths of the phylogenetic tree relating the analyzed species ( Fig. 2 ) .
This methodology implements a generalized least squares ( GLS ) model and likelihood ratio tests to resolve whether correlation between two characters is dependent on the underlying phylogeny [ 31 ] , [ 32 ] .

Many explanations have been put forth for the persistence of parthenogens in the arid zone and elsewhere [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 48 ] - [ 50 ] , and the role of climatic cycling in hybridization is well-documented [ 51 ] .
It may be the case that similar climatic conditions have driven the hybridization events resulting in other arid zone parthenogens , and that similar factors constrain their distributions .
We were able to make robust inferences about the history of the H. binoei complex in relation to climatic cycles by combining population genetic approaches with climatic and biophysical distribution modeling .
This methodology should also be very valuable for understanding the prevalence of hybrid parthenogenesis in the Australian arid zone , and for addressing the role of abiotic factors in the formation , spread , and persistence of parthenogenetic lineages more generally .

Single-locus phylogeographic studies are typically limited by the fact that they can not account for inter-locus variability due to both mutational and coalescent stochasticity .

Dating of NCPA inferences was performed using the method of Templeton [ 20 ] .

The degree of attenuation afforded by manipulation of the dam gene has led to the proposal that Dam inhibitors could find application as broad spectrum antibiotics [ 9 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] .
To identify compounds with an inhibitory effect , a reliable assay for Dam activity is required , ideally one readily adapted to high throughput screening .
Perhaps the most reliable reported method for measurement of Dam activity involved monitoring the incorporation of a 3H labelled methyl group ( transferred from 3H labelled AdoMet ) to an adenine residue within a DNA substrate , typically either calf thymus DNA [ 14 ] or a short double stranded oligonucleotide [ 15 ] .
This method has allowed the kinetic analysis of a number of DNA adenine methyltransferases , including that from E. coli [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , bacteriophage T2 [ 18 ] and bacteriophage T4 [ 19 ] , but using this type of discontinuous assay for detailed kinetic studies is labour intensive .

The aim of this paper is to develop methods for estimating reproduction numbers which are simple enough that they could be applied with limited data or in real time during an outbreak .
I present a new estimator for the individual reproduction number , which describes the state of the epidemic at a point in time rather than tracking individuals over time , and discuss some potential benefits .
Then , to capture more of the detail that micro-simulations have shown is important in outbreak dynamics , I analyse a model of transmission within and between households , and develop a method to estimate the household reproduction number , defined as the number of households infected by each infected household .
This method is validated by numerical simulations of the spread of influenza and measles using historical data , and estimates are obtained for would-be emerging epidemics of these viruses .

There are two popular methods commonly used to build a realistic protein / membrane complex .
In the first method , lipid-like pseudo atoms are first distributed around a protein and then replaced by lipid molecules one at a time [ 19 ] - [ 21 ] .
Individual lipid molecules are randomly selected from a lipid library that contains various conformations of lipid molecules .
This method allows one to easily control the system size and the number of lipid molecules while it generates a lipid bilayer nicely packed around the protein .

This method allows one to easily control the system size and the number of lipid molecules while it generates a lipid bilayer nicely packed around the protein .
In the second method , a hole is first created in a pre-equilibrated lipid bilayer and then the membrane protein is inserted into the hole [ 22 ] - [ 24 ] .
In general , weak repulsive radial forces perpendicular to the membrane normal are applied to a lipid bilayer until the hole is large enough to accommodate the protein .
This method provides a well-equilibrated lipid bilayer , and one might expect less equilibration time than in the first method .

At the heart of the ITD is the function αq ( tot , Zq ) which , for a stand q , gives the total exposed crown area ( ha ha−1 ) vs distance from the ground , Zq ( Appendix S1 ) .
This function is exactly equal to the probability of a given LIDAR measurement returning a canopy height greater than Zq ( also see Fig 1d ) .
Therefore the ITD can be used to assess which species , densities and sizes of trees are consistent with a given sample of LIDAR returns .
This method would engage with the whole sample of return heights , rather than summary statistics such as the mean height .

This approach is appealing as it classifies the variables , ranks them based on their contribution to reducing the total AIC , and retains the most parsimonious combination of variables .
However , using usual stepwise regression to find the optimal combination of explanatory variables to model a response is often considered to be a high-variance operation because small perturbations of the response data can sometimes lead to vastly different subsets of the variables [ 51 ] , [ 52 ] .
To avoid this problem , and to measure the actual power of each variable , we used multimodal inference based on all-subsets selection of generalised linear mixed effects models ( GLMM ) ( [ 53 ] ) .
This method has been proven to be more robust and useful than stepwise regression [ 53 ] - [ 55 ] , and allows the measurement of the weight of evidence with which each explanatory variable explains the response variable [ 53 ] .

In Table 1 , the range of within-hour variance explained by the 3 score estimates is given in the FA columns , where it can be seen that any of the 3 estimators explains more variance than the RA method in each of the compound classes and LD / DD conditions .

Note that method ( c ) , weighted mean abundance , would be more appropriate in studies focused on methyl-alkanes and n-alkanes .
This method allows less abundant compounds to contribute more to score estimates , which is also true of log-based methods such as logcontrast .

These data suggest that eQTL data from male and female mice should be analyzed separately , as many effects , such as trans regulation are sex specific .
The combination of quantitative trait locus ( QTL ) mapping and gene expression profiling allows for the identification of expression quantitative trait loci ( eQTLs ) , which are loci associated with the expression of each transcript .

GO fold-enrichment values of > 1 indicate that a GO term occurs more frequently in a gene list compared with the frequency of the term in the genome and suggests that the GO term is representative of a coordinated change in transcript accumulation relevant to the process examined .
Conversely , GO enrichment of < 1 , which can also be expressed as fold-depletion ( 1 / fold-enrichment ) , indicates that the GO term occurs less frequently in the list than a random list and may indicate general lack of or reduced participation of certain processes or compartments .

The strategy is based on the use of type IIs restriction enzymes , which cut outside of their recognition sequence .
With proper design of the cleavage sites , two fragments cut by type IIs restriction enzymes can be ligated into a product lacking the original restriction site .

In this method , a recombination map composed by a series of intervals each with constant recombination rate is fit on the multiple alignment .
For each interval , the recombination rate is estimated by using an extended composite likelihood approximation of the coalescent likelihood [ 12 ] , [ 30 ] .

ChIP-seq allows transcription factor and histone patterning of complex mammalian genomes to be identified at high resolution , and the interrogation of virtually an entire mammalian genome is now possible .
As HTP sequencing technology can be difficult to access and expensive to use , a method to inspect sequencing library quality and genomic enrichment for ChIP-seq experiments in advance of deep sequencing would be of substantial utility to a wide number of researchers [ 14 ] .
Here we report such a methodology ( Microarrays-before-Sequencing , Mab-seq ) , which should also be of interest to investigators using chromatin immunoprecipitations who are working primarily with microarrays , but wish to bank material for later genome-wide interrogations .
This method also offers advantages to investigators with access to HTP instruments ( e.g. Illumina Genome Analyzer ) who wish to test their libraries prior to sequencing without compromising either experimental approach by sample loss .

We developed Microarray-before-sequencing ( Mab-seq ) for use in ChIP experiments with both transcription factor binding and chromatin modification assays .
We modified DNA library preparation for the Illumina Genome Analyzer to allow the small amounts of ChIP-enriched DNA to be simultaneously used on both commercially available microarrays and Illumina sequencers ( Figure 1A ) .
This methodology was demonstrated by performing ChIP on hepatocytes isolated directly from mouse liver using well-characterized antisera against the liver-enriched transcription factor Hnf4α [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 15 ] and the trimethylated lysine 4 of histone H3 [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 12 ] .

The Mab-seq protocol allows the reliable detection of transcription factor binding sites and modified histones using a common pool of ChIP-enriched DNA for microarray hybridization and deep sequencing .
Mab-seq provides excellent library validation prior to sequencing , and thus can be used to compare different libraries for experimental prioritization .
Because ChIP sequencing library creation is comparable in most aspects , including cost , to standard ChIP-chip libraries , our methodology can be used to generate valuable data and a validated collection of libraries in advance of access to a next-generation sequencer .
This method can immediately be applied to similar assays such as mapping of DNase hypersensitivity sites , FAIRE and ChIP-SNP [ 12 ] , [ 17 ] - [ 19 ] .

Moreover , being close to several dendritic branches , many individual axonal terminals at DCCs made multiple synapses on different branches ( Figure 6h ) .
Hence , the presence of DCCs increases the number of neurons innervated by single axons in the cultured network .
To check the role of dendritic convergence in shaping network architecture , we adopted the ‘Economical Small World Network ( ESWN ) ’ analysis [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] .
This method estimates the overall efficiency of connectivity scheme in a network by providing information on its potential to propagate signals and its robustness ( for a detailed explanation , see Supplemental Material S1 section 4a ) : 1. global efficiency - a value between 0 and 1 which reflects the speed of parallel information spread across entire networks and is inversely proportional to the average length of ‘shortcuts’ among distant network nodes .

We identified individual genes that exhibited statistically significant differential expression as a result of PDGF treatment in each null experiment ( i.e. , genes induced or repressed in the α− / − β− / − , α +/+ β− / − , α− / −β +/+ , α +/+ β +/+ cells when treated with PDGF-BB ) using SAM method [ 14 ] .
In each comparison we selected a value for SAM 's Δ parameter to specify a median false discovery rate less than 0.05 , and we consider the genes reported at this threshold to be differentially expressed between the treatment and non-treatment conditions .
To identify functional groups of genes from each cell line with RNA expression profiles that were affected by PDGF-BB treatment , we used Tian et al 's [ 15 ] sigPathway method Gene set annotations were assembled from Gene Ontology [ 36 ] , KEGG [ 37 ] , BioCarta ( biocarta.com ) , BioCyc [ 38 ] and custom data .
This method identifies significantly enriched gene sets by testing two related null hypotheses : 1 ) The pattern of expression for the genes in a particular gene set is the same as all the other genes , and 2 ) the gene set does not contain genes with expression profiles that are correlated with treatment .

Combining SI-labeling techniques can also support them .
For example , 13C-labeled positions inside a molecule offer a hint about paths of molecular conversions .
Our graphic representation may not be adequate to serve as a quantitative tool for understanding these higher dimensional correlations , but the apparent coarse-grained patterns of increasing and decreasing 13C intensities in metabolites and pathways occurred coincidently throughout related metabolic pathways during the period from ecdysis to the fifth instar .
This method can thus be used to screen physiological changes in organisms by using coarse-grained views of metabolic pathways in which it would be useful to have an overview of several specific metabolic states .

This is in contrast to other methods where the GO information takes precedence over the subsequent analysis .
One disadvantage of methods based centrally on GO information is that the prior knowledge is typically generated for certain sets of conditions and cell-types , so that the information generated may not be universally valid ( for every cell type and treatment condition ) .
Our experience has shown that there exists an optimal value of the GO-contribution ( τ ) , beyond which the separation deteriorates .
This method allows one to take this into consideration and control the GO-contribution to achieve the best discrimination among the subpopulations .

Clustering by sequence similarity allows for an interpretation of a comprehensive set of genes and open reading frames that are predicted by various gene finder algorithms .
A cluster of similar sequences ( or a single sequence ) is representative of a predicted gene at the genomic locus despite the fact that there may be some discrepancy in the exact structure of the gene in question due to differences in the predicted sequences .

We found that a two step filtering approach could be applied to different biological replicates , and even different types of experiments ( not shown ) , as long as the pool contained the same cohort of deletion strains .

Despite the fact that vertebrate and invertebrate tissue repair and related phases such as angiogenesis , associated haematopoiesis , and cytokine implications are well known processes in vivo , in vitro studies on to role of stem cells in these processes are to date quite limited .
This is mostly due to the difficulty in isolation of somatic stem cells from tissues in significant numbers .
Here we describe a method that allows isolation of a specific cell populations that also simplifies culture of cell types in vitro whose isolation and culture is otherwise quite difficult .
This method is not only invaluable for studying and charactering the cells involved in wound healing responses but also could be a simple system for select specific cell populations in vivo to then culture them in vitro .

After 48h in vivo , we were able to remove the matrigel biopolymer containing the migrated cells from the body of animals under sterile conditions and culture the implants in vitro .
This allowed us to isolate specific cell populations in vitro with the same appearance and expressing the same specific markers ( both superficial and cytoplasmic ) as found in vivo , suggesting that the staminal cell nature of the cells infiltrating the matrigel can be preserved upon passage into culture .
To the best of our knowledge , this study describes , for the first time , a method allowing not only the isolation of a specific cell population in relation to the cytokine utilized but also the possibility to culture these precise cell types whose isolation has been very difficult to date .
This method will not only be invaluable for studying and charactering cells involved in leech wound healing responses but it could be also an easy system to select specific cell populations for in vitro culture , expansion and differentiation analyses .

The values of X in the allometric equation with the form Y = bXα were generated using the function ranuni , which produces any value within a given range with equal probability , hence assuming a uniform distribution .
The data generated represented six categories of range that the variable X might have in organisms , starting from the minimum value X = 5 and ranging maximally from 3- to 25-fold differences ( i.e. between 5 and 15 and 5 to 125 ) .
The actual range of X within each category was variable because of the use of uniformly distributed random values for generating X , and the addition of normally distributed error ( see below ) , but in more than 50 % of the individual datasets the true range within each category was at least 5× ( range multiplier − 1 ) , where the range multiplier was 3 for 3-fold differences , 4 for 4-fold differences , etc .
This method was sufficient for incorporating the effect of data range in the analysis .

We took the cutoff to be where the slope of this line first became negative ( Figure 7A and B , vertical gray line ) .

Due to the different number of maternal trees on the upper and lower plateau , the loss of several patches to feral pigs that broke into the CMA and to weeders working in the CMA , our experimental design was unbalanced .
Furthermore , for the calculation and analyses of proportions of seeds germinated we needed to take the number of initial seeds in each patch into account .
We therefore analysed seedling germination patterns with a generalised linear mixed-effects model with penalised quasi-likelihood ( hereafter GLMM ) ( glmmPQL function in R.2.4.1 , using the MASS library [ 36 ] ) , with plateau , distance , propagule , cage and Time as fixed effects , maternal tree as a random effect , and using a binomial error structure .
This method is robust for unbalanced data , and by using the ‘cbind’ command to calculate the germination proportions we weighted the sample sizes ( number of seeds and seedlings per patch ) .

Most of the patients without DQ2.5 and DQ8 , carried half of the DQ2.5 or DQ2.2 molecule ( either HLA-DQA1*05 or -DQB1*0202 ) suggesting that carrying part of the risk molecules has functional implications for the risk of CD [ 4 ] , [ 22 ] .
Of our patient group 98.4 % carry one of the risk groups ( DQ2.2 , DQ2.5 , DQ7 , DQ8 or the DQ types that have half of the risk haplotypes ) and 98.3 % of all patients were correctly predicted using our method .
Overall , the sensitivity was 0.997 , the specificity was > 0.929 and predictive value was > 0.987 when taking into account that some of the false predictions included an allele that is part of a risk haplotype ( e.g. the HLA-DQA1*05 allele which is part of the DQ2.5 haplotype , see person nos. 10-12 in Table S3b ) .

These results indicate that access to the cytoplasm is a major limiting factor for expression of non-codon-optimized sequences .
However previous studies have not made precise comparisons of the translational efficiency of codon-optimized versus non-optimized gag RNA , and it is not known to what degree codon usage per se affects translational efficiency of HIV transcripts .

The probability of winning of an individual over another depends both on chance and on its DOM-value relative to that of the other ( i.e. its DOM-value divided by the sum of the DOM-values of both partners ) .
To reflect the self-reinforcing effects of victory and defeat , DOM-values are updated by increasing the DOM-value of the winner and decreasing that of the loser by the same amount .
Furthermore , the size of the change in the DOM-value depends on the intensity of aggression and on the degree to which the outcome of a fight was expected : if a high ranking one wins from a low-ranking one as expected , this results in a minimal change in both DOM-values , but if unexpectedly , a low ranking one outcompetes a higher ranking individual , DOM-values of both opponents are changed by a larger amount .

Our quantitative method required some internal control of endogenous expression to give an accurate measure of levels .
This was not a concern with endogenous Armadillo or E-Cadherin , as wild type cells outside the overexpression domain act as the standard .
However , in order to reliably compare mutant protein levels across experiments , it was necessary to set levels to equal 1 within the central or “high” domain of expression .
This method allowed an estimate of relative levels of construct in the “low” expression or “lateral” domain relative to the “high” domain , as it considered these to be a proportion of 1 .

In this work we have demonstrated an easy and fast in vitro methodology to screen candidate microbicide and spermicide surfactants in the struggle against conception and STD .
This methodology demonstrated that the quaternary CnTAB surfactants , at non-toxic concentrations towards polarized epithelial cells , are effective against bacteria and yeast , but are not spermicidal nor do they offer protection against adenovirus and lentivirus infection at concentrations that are sub-lethal to epithelial cells .

Two groups of 10-year-old children selected to have stable low or high mathematical ability ( as assessed on three occasions at seven , nine , and ten years of age ) were studied .
This is thus the first study to date to examine individual differences in brain processing of non-symbolic approximation using longitudinal data to select two stable extreme ( rather than poor vs. average ) groups of children of the same age .
This method of sample selection should maximize putative neural differences between groups .

For comparison , this method was then repeated with data from 14 putatively neutral microsatellite loci ( Teacher 2009 , PhD thesis , University of London ) , using data for the same populations as used for the MHC analyses ( Rv+ = 77 individuals , mean per population = 11 ; Rv− = 61 individuals , mean per population = 9 ) to investigate whether the Rv+ and Rv− populations were , by chance , more genetically distinct than average .
We used FDist2 [ 27 ] implemented in Lositan [ 39 ] to further assess the effect of any selection on the variation between populations at the MHC or microsatellite loci .
The program compares the FST of marker loci with simulated expected values ( conditional on their heterozygosity ) , and identifies outliers .
This method was applied to Rv+ and Rv− populations individually and combined , using data at the MHC locus , together with data for the same populations from the 14 microsatellite loci to provide information on neutral expectations .

We computed for each microRNA-mRNA pair a z-score from the total free energy of binding of the microRNA and the native 3′UTR sequence and the total free energies of binding of the microRNA with 20 shuffled versions of the same 3′UTR sequence .
The z-score for each microRNA was used to compute a Fisher exact test based on the counts of positive and negative z-scores in upregulated or nonregulated mRNAs .
Since the total free binding energy of a 3′UTR was compared with its dinucleotide shuffled counterparts , the results obtained did not need to be normalized or corrected for length or G+C content effects .
This methodology is similar but not identical to the approach described by Stark et al. [ 36 ] , where it is demonstrated that the often overlooked negative selection of microRNA-target interactions ( the avoidance of microRNA binding sites on the 3′UTR ) can provide important insights into microRNA function .

Each cytoskeletal filament is represented by a series of rigid segments linked end-to-end in series with a variable attachment point for the translational elastic element .
This connection scheme allows an empirically tuning , for a wide range of segment sizes , viscosities , and time-steps , that endows any filament species with the experimentally observed ( or theoretically expected ) static force deflection , relaxation time-constant , and thermal writhing motions .
I additionally employ a unique pair of elastic elements - one representing the axial and the other the bending rigidity- that formulate the restoring force in terms of single time-step constraint resolution .
This method is highly local -adjacent rigid segments of a filament only interact with one another through constraint forces—and is thus well-suited to simulations in which arbitrary additional forces ( e.g. those representing interactions of a filament with other bodies or cross-links / entanglements between filaments ) may be present .

In addition to our primary set of 910 genes , the mouse systems genetics method ( Chesler and colleagues , submitted ) that identified 7,842 additional genes with potential biological relevance to addiction through mouse QTL and gene expression correlation analysis and the GIN prioritization scores reflect this quantitative assessment of biological relevance .
Genes with a large number of mouse associations are prioritized more highly , and those with a relatively low number receive little increase in the prioritization score relative to arbitrary genes ( see the methods section for details ) .
These additional data provide a broader measure of biological relevance to addiction which may be useful for prioritizing SNPs for further study after a GWAS [ 4 ] or fine mapping a region of genetic linkage .

In order to determine the coverage of regions inferred to be undergoing recent adaptive selection [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] , all SNPs detected by the LD decay ( LDD ) test in the Perlegen and HapMap datasets were compared to the Illumina 1M and Affymetrix 6.0 SNPs .
Uncovering evidence for recent selection is an additional approach to defining functional human genomic variation .
The LDD test identifies alleles undergoing selection by searching for an expected increase with distance in the fraction of inferred recombinant chromosomes surrounding a selected variant .
This method is insensitive to local recombination rate because it relies on LD differences between the two alleles at a site , while the local rate influences the extent of LD surrounding both alleles .

A third group , Liu et al. [ 45 ] , also found evidence for functional SR Ca2+stores in hESC-CMs , albeit only in a minority of cardiomyocytes .
Of note , all three groups largely relied on hESC-CMs generated using the “historical” method of embryoid body differentiation ( i.e. the formation of spontaneously differentiating three-dimensional aggregates in high fetal calf serum ( FCS ) ) .
The present study is the first to examine intracellular Ca2+ signaling in hESC-CMs resulting from our recently reported guided differentiation protocol ( involving serial activin A and BMP-4 under serum-free , monolayer culture conditions ) .
This method results in preparations of substantially higher cardiac purity ( typically > 60 % cardiomyocytes , versus < 1 % cardiomyocytes via embryoid body differentiation ) , greatly facilitating biophysical studies with hESC-CMs , but it could in principle result in cardiomyocytes with a different functional phenotype .

Laboratories employing fewer categories have the advantage of fewer definitions , but incur the costs of coarser calibration and attendant lower resolution .
Finally , assigning a mouse to a coat-color category requires the grader to estimate the amount of yellow in the mouse 's coat ; this is currently a largely subjective process .

This method thus has the potential to allow for comparisons of experimental data between different studies and research groups .

Another mapping strategy is “genome-wide linkage approach” .
This method , which uses hundreds to thousands of short tandem-repeat polymorphisms and a large number of families , has been used in various studies that suggested multiple potential locations of hypertension genes for further research ; however , the indicated regions of interest are often too broad and are not consistent across multiple studies [ 5 ] .

We thereby assumed that P. vulgatissima was present in each stand every year but that they sometimes occurred at densities too low to be detected by our sampling method .
Population variability ( PV ) , which is a relatively new method proposed for measuring temporal variation [ 18 ] , quantifies variability as the average percentage difference between all combinations of data points and was calculated using MATLAB .
PV is supposed to be less sensitive to extreme events , such as zero counts and large deviations from the mean , than CV .
This method is therefore especially appropriate when comparing variability of populations experiencing different types of dynamics because PV measures variability on a proportional scale .

With this normalization method , the QPCR signal derived from the sequence of interest is divided by the signal derived from the positive sequence control ( s ) , assuming that the chromatin structure at the control sequence does not differ between samples , and that consequently all signal variation is of technical origin .
The advantage of this method is that the same ChIP samples are used to analyze sequences of interest and control sequences , eliminating variation caused by sample handling .
The disadvantage of this method is that the development and characterization of positive control sequences for all histone modifications of interest can be laborious .
This method requires consistent positive QPCR signals for the positive control sequence with all antibodies used .

We describe an end-point and real-time looped RT-PCR procedure and demonstrate detection of miRNAs from as little as 20 pg of plant tissue total RNA and from total RNA isolated from as little as 0.1 μl of phloem sap .
In addition , we have developed an alternative real-time PCR assay that can further improve specificity when detecting low abundant miRNAs .
Using this assay , we have demonstrated that miRNAs are differentially expressed in the phloem sap and the surrounding vascular tissue .
This method enables fast , sensitive and specific miRNA expression profiling and is suitable for facilitation of high-throughput detection and quantification of miRNA expression .

An important prerequisite for the analysis of such phenotypic variability is the ability to accurately quantify plant freezing tolerance and cold acclimation responses .
It is generally agreed in the field that the primary targets of freezing damage in plants are cellular membranes ( see [ 13 , 14 ] for comprehensive reviews ) .
Consequently , besides whole plant survival , the determination of electrolyte leakage from plant tissues after freezing and thawing , using conductivity measurements , has been the most frequently used method reported in the literature ( see e.g. [ 15 ] and references therein ) .
This method mainly monitors the ability of the plasma membrane to function as a semi-permeable barrier towards intracellular ions , but the intactness of the vacuole , as the major storage compartment for inorganic ions , may also impact the measurements .

We therefore sought to develop a robust quantitative analysis using crude soluble plant extracts by exploiting the high sensitivity of LC / MS .
Here we present a method for determining ABA , JA and SA from a single extract that is rapid , accurate , technically simple and requires minimal amounts of tissue .
The nature of the method lends itself to high throughput phytohormone determination from time-delimited sampling of plant responses in which these hormones are suspected to participate .
This method provides several advantages over previously published methods which individually measure ABA , JA and SA [ 17-19 ] as these approaches require time-consuming additional steps such as partitioning of the extracts , solvent evaporation by the use of a rotary evaporator , drying of the sample under N2 and resuspension of the residue .

To provide material with representative amounts of the three phytohormones , six leaves on four , 5-week old plants were first wounded with a plastic pipette tip ( induction of JA biosynthesis ) and then left to dessicate for 2 h ( induction of ABA ) .
Material was harvested in aluminium foil , frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen , crushed to generate a homogeneous mixture and freeze dried .
Seven 10 mg samples of freeze dried material were extracted after the incorporation of deuterated hormone standards and each hormone was expressed as a ratio of phytohormone to deuterated internal standard ( IS ) .
This method produces highly reproducible quantitation as determined by the mean ratios of phytohormone / IS and associated standard errors ( maximum of 10 % of replicate means ) as shown in Table 1 .

Because the DM registry used in this study contains information on disease incidence , prevalence and duration of disease , and age of death , it is possible to estimate the changing HRQOL impact over time and age based on either disease incidence or prevalence , thereby opening novel opportunities to improve estimates of summary measures ( including health gap , health expectancy or hybrid measures ) by considering the effect of changing disease incidence on future HRQOL [ 48 ] .
An additional benefit of using linked data and population health surveys is the ability to adjust summary measure estimates for comorbidity ( defined as the effect of a person 's HRQOL being influenced by other chronic conditions ) by various methods [ 39 ] .
In this study , we adjusted for comorbidity by assuming the HRQOL burden of DM is equal to the difference in HRQOL between people with and without DM at the same age and sex .
This method assumes that if DM were eliminated , the HRQOL would improve to the level of the remaining population , many of whom have other conditions .

Unfortunately , because of small numbers , we could not calculate rates adjusted by race or ethnicity , although disparities in cancer rates may exist for these groups and may warrant further investigation .
We created the maps by using adaptive spatial filtering ( 22 , 23 ) that was adapted from a fixed filter method ( 24 ) .
Adaptive spatial filtering is achieved by placing a grid of points over the study area and calculating the rate for each grid point by pulling in data from the surrounding area by using a circular filter until a threshold is met for the denominator .
This method eliminates much of the instability in cancer rates that occurs because of differences in population sizes of areal units .

In addition , the development of a genetic model would permit the direct testing of oncogenes and tumor suppressors for their contribution to the initiation and progression of overt malignancies in the mouse ovary .
Finally , a number of different factors could be altered such as the genetic background of the mouse strain , the frequency of ovulation and the levels of various hormones to determine their impact on the development of tumors in the susceptible transgenic mouse line .
One approach to alter gene expression directly in the OSE cells would be to take advantage of the fact that these cells readily take up and express genes delivered by intra-bursal injection of adenoviruses [ 94 , 95 ] .

The Tol2 transpoase gene can be produced from a heterologous promoter , while the transposon itself can be altered so that it contains a foreign gene cassette [ 27 ] .
This two-part system can thus be used for a variety of gene transfer purposes .
To date highly efficient germline transgenesis of the Zebrafish , Dana rario , has been achieved by co-injection of in vitro transcribed mRNA for the transposase with transposon vector DNA into the one cell embryo [ 27 ] .

One of the most critical and difficult steps in successful cloning of any species is the reprogramming of oocytes to divide in the absence of fertilization .
Optimization of this step , termed parthenogenetic activation , is very empirical , and it varies greatly between species .
To increase the yield of oocytes for NT cloning , ovaries are often harvested and immature oocytes extracted for use .
This method requires a step involving in vitro maturation ( IVM ) , which must also be optimized prior to activation .

As human sperm chromatin condensation follows a seasonal rhythm , which even shows a shift of about half a year on the southern hemisphere [ 83 ] , this might have a clinical impact on the results in IVF .
Should a patient be examined in winter when the quality of sperm chromatin condensation is high [ 83 ] and referred to IVF in summer when the percentage of normally chromatin-condensed spermatozoa is significantly lower , IVF for this patient might fail .
Thus , for these patients a sperm separation by means of glass wool filtration , PureSperm® or migration-sedimentation might be beneficial .

To date , two different approaches for the distinction between live and dead spermatozoa have been pursued ; ( i ) the initiation of motility as sign of vitality by means of stimulants and ( ii ) the identification of live spermatozoa according to their membrane integrity by means of the hypo-osmotic swelling test ( HOS test ) .
The initiation of motility in an immotile sperm population is just a consequence of the idea to improve motility by means of the PDE inhibitor pentoxifylline as described above .
As pentoxifylline stimulates motility without altering the sperm membrane [ 238 ] it appeared as an ideal substance to initiate motility in immotile spermatozoa .
This method was successfully used to identify live testicular and epididymal spermatozoa and live births are reported [ 155,156,239 ] .

As mentioned above , rhesus sperm will not spontaneously capacitate , but instead require dibutyryl cyclic AMP ( dbcAMP ) and caffeine to activate sperm [ 6 ] .
The motility changes that typically indicate that activation has been successful include a marked increase in lateral head displacement and rapid changes in sperm swimming trajectory [ 22 ] .
Although either of these chemicals should lead to an increase in intracellular cAMP , both are necessary to support activated motility changes and IVF .
This method of chemical capacitation presents a problem of appropriate timing of insemination of oocytes .

However , a major randomized controlled trial of supplementation with the main antioxidant vitamins C , E , and beta-carotene recently failed to identify any beneficial effect on COPD outcomes [ 5 ] .
One possibility is that the effects of these particular nutrients operate at an earlier point in the natural history of COPD , or that the observational evidence is confounded by the effects of other nutrients or lifestyle factors , or it is possible that these nutrients do not have universal benefit and only certain subgroups would benefit from supplementation .
Much of the available epidemiological evidence is based on findings using food frequency questionnaires to assess diet .
This method of assessing nutritional status has potential limitations [ 6 ] .

To validate our approach and determine the hybridization specificity for each virus , DNA was isolated from host cells in culture infected with a single viral species ( Figure 2A ) , plasmid DNA of infectious clones ( Figure 2B ) , or genomic DNA of co-infected cells ( Figure 2C ) , labeled , and hybridized to the array .
With the exception of the plasmid clone hybridizations , uninfected host cell DNA was used as a common reference sample for each competitive hybridization assay .
Purified DNA was labeled using random primers and the Klenow fragment of the E. coli DNA polymerase such that labeling occurred irrespective of the sequence .
This method for labeling allowed us to label any viral strain without prior knowledge of the sequence and , more importantly , did not require PCR amplification to detect specific and strong hybridization .

The phylogenetic trees and Kimura 2-parameter mean distances show a higher homogeneity within the plasma RNA and LTR episomal DNA groups of each patient .
In addition , Wilcoxon 's signed ranks tests ( p < 0.05 ) from 101 clones , demonstrated that the nucleotide distances between the episomes vs. plasma and episomes vs. PBMCs were significantly different for the three patients .
These findings support our hypothesis showing that episomal DNA is apparently reflecting the viral quasispecies present in plasma RNA , especially in the patient with the lowest viral load .

After an initial burst of viral replication and cell death , a population of non-productive cells carrying an integrated provirus remains .
Establishment of latency in these cell lines is driven by selection of cells that resist viral replication and has been linked to mutation in viral genes , to certain cellular proteins and to the site of integration [ 26-29 ] .
Alternatively , T cells can be transduced with an HIV-1 vector carrying Tat and a reporter gene .

Taken together , the substantial array of alterations to the ATP binding pocket of VRK3 strongly suggest that it is nonfunctional , and that the structure has evolved adaptations to compensate for the loss of ATP binding .
We tested the degeneration of the ATP binding pocket by assaying the ability of VRK3 to bind ATP or ATP-analog inhibitors .
Purified VRK1 , VRK2 , and VRK3 proteins were screened against ATP ( plus divalent cations ) and a kinase-directed library of 605 low-molecular-weight potential inhibitors by monitoring changes in protein melting temperature during thermal denaturation ( Lo et al. , 2004 ) .

SSR markers RM42 and RM284 spanning the aroma gene region were selected to identify 40 recombinant lines for adding markers and for rapid screening of aroma by the smelling method after soaking seeds in KOH solution .
Additional mapping of RM515 , RM8265 , RM223 markers allowed us to reduce the number of informative recombinants to nine independent RILs ( 16C , 19A , 35B , 122A , 159B , 164A , 186A , 259B and 274A ) ( Table 2 ) .
As the data obtained by direct sniffing assays could not be considered as completely reliable because of the subjective nature of this method , the 2-ACP concentration in each of the nine recombinants was also measured by GC ( Table 3 ) .

The charge compatibility distribution became more similar to the size and hydrophobe compatibility distributions after the lowest scores ( SeqQ 80 / NF 0 to 1 ) were omitted , filtering the data for nonspecific values ( Fig. 3 ) .

For simplicity , I have assumed that RBC formation is either normal or abnormal ( iron deficient or folate deficient ) although the model changes little if we assume a gradual transition .
I have made no attempt to include the effects of other factors such as erythropoietin on blood formation .
This method of detecting deficiencies in iron and folate does not supplant standard measures of serum iron and folate , but rather provides a useful tool in regions where anaemia is prevalent and resources limited .

Severity scores have been created in developed nations ( for instance , Guy’s Prognostic Score , Canadian Neurological Score , and the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale ) .
However , we propose a method for developing scores appropriate to local settings in possibly very different medical circumstances .
Specifically , we used a freely available and easy to use exploratory regression technique ( POLYCLASS ) to predict 30-day mortality following stroke in a rural Indian population and compared the accuracy of the technique with these existing stroke scales , resulting in more accurate prediction than the existing scores ( POLYCLASS sensitivity and specificity of 90 % and 76 % , respectively ) .
This method can easily be extrapolated to different clinical settings and for different disease outcomes .

Initial studies with WC3 , a G6P [ 5 ] bovine rotavirus developed as a vaccine candidate a short time later , also appeared promising ( Clark et al 1988 ) .
However , subsequent trials did not show significant protection ( Bernstein et al 1990 ; Georges-Courbot et al 1991 ) , and studies with this candidate vaccine were also terminated .
In an attempt to make the WC3 vaccine more serotypically related to human strains , genes encoding the VP4 and VP7 neutralization proteins from human rotaviruses were introduced into WC3 by gene reassortment .

Again , CCHFV GN expression from the two expression plasmids pCMV GNs and pCMV GNl overlapped with Golgi staining ( Fig. 4 : e , f ) , whereas GC expression overlapped with that of calreticulin ( Fig. 4 : d ) .
However , co-expression of both CCHFV glycoproteins either from the glycoprotein precursor plasmid or from simultaneous transfection of the two expression plasmids resulted in Golgi targeting of both glycoproteins ( Fig. 4 : c , g ) strongly indicating that GN drives the Golgi localization and that GC needs to interact with GN in order to be transported out of the ER .

RT-PCR is usually not necessary for DNA viruses , because the viral genomic DNA itself can be detected without the intermediate step of reverse transcriptase to create cDNA .
However , since the unique latent biology of HHV-8 renders DNA PCR of HHV-8 relatively insensitive , RT-PCR should be studied more thoroughly as an alternative diagnostic test for the detection of HHV-8 infection .
The rationale is that detection of mRNA provides a built in preamplification step for detection of the viral nucleic acid , because mRNA is at a higher copy number than the corresponding genomic DNA .

A study by Playforth et al in 1987 describes a scoring system applied to 1517 consecutive patients of all ages undergoing major abdominal surgery [ 13 ] .
Emergency operations accounted for 50 % of this cohort and 46 % of these patients were over 70 years old .
The 26 risk factors were chosen by the authors and weighted arbitrarily from 1 - 4 with , for example , Haemoglobin < 10 g / dL scoring 1 and age > 80 years scoring 4 .
This method calls into doubt the likely validity of this scoring system .

At the moment it is not clear how to combine the use of different phones with different power output , different systems , different frequencies , and different anatomical SAR distribution , into one exposure and dose measure .
The difficulties lay in the fact that we do not know the interacting mechanism ( s ) between the electromagnetic fields emitted from the phone and the biological organism .
We used a weighting method as described above to combine exposure measurement from different phone types ; NMT = 1 , GSM = 0 , 1 and cordless phones = 0.01 .
This method was applied for data in our second brain tumour study [ 4 , 5 ] and has been discussed elsewhere [ 17 , 18 ] .

A number of minimal invasive approaches to the distal ureter such as endoscopic stripping or pluck-off techniques have been reported [ 8-11 ] .
However , these endoscopic techniques have a greater risk of local recurrence and stone formation in the staple lines [ 12 ] .
We prefer open distal ureterectomy and bladder cuff excision .
This method avoids the risk of urinary leakage and allows for intact specimen removal .

The connective tissue attachments between the portal vein / SMV and SMA can then be divided , thereby isolating the vessels .
This " medial " approach allows for early dissection and evaluation of the critical vascular structures .
Once the relation of the tumor to these structures has been established , more lateral dissection along the spleen and tail of the pancreas can be accomplishing with little difficulty .
This method of dissecting the SMA and SMV first allows the surgeon to avoid committing to an extensive resection prior to determining whether or not an R0 resection is feasible .

However , given the fact that not more than 300 cases of extended DP were reported on until now , more control studies with larger series are critical to draw a more convincing conclusion ( Table 3 ) .
Central pancreatectomy ( CP ) , also known as segmental , middle or medial pancreatectomy , has been proposed as an alternative approach in patients with small , benign or low-grade malignant tumors such as endocrine and cystic neoplasms located in the neck of the pancreas .
The rationale for CP is to remove the neoplasm with preservation of the functional parenchyma , and thereby avoiding a major resection such as PD or DP .
This method reduces the risk of diabetes and exocrine insufficiency , and maintains the upper digestive and biliary anatomy [ 40 , 41 ] .
